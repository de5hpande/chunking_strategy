If the same freedom, in consequence of the same \\nuniformity, could be extended to Ireland and the plantations, both the grandeur \\nof the state and the prosperity of every part of the empire, would probably be still \\ngreater than at present” \\n— Adam Smith in ‘Wealth of Nations’ \\n1. Introductory \\nGoods and Services Tax, which is better known by its acronym, GST, is the \\nbiggest indirect tax reform in India, since independence. GST introduces a single \\ntax within the federal structure of our nation. It is a tax on the supply of goods \\nand services, levied at every point of consumption of goods or services, from the \\nstage of the manufacturer to the final stage of consumer. GST is a destination \\nbased tax and is based on the principles of Value Added Taxation. Most of the \\nprovisions of GST have been borrowed from the erstwhile provisions of Central \\nExcise, Service Tax and State’s VAT laws. \\nGST has a dual tax structure wherein it comprises of Central Goods and \\nServices Tax (CGST) on the one hand and State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) \\nor Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (UTGST) on the other. The tax has \\nbeen implemented in the country with effect from 1st July, 2017. \\n2. Constitutional scheme of indirect taxation in India before GST \\n2.1 Article 265 of the Constitution of India provides that no tax shall be \\nlevied or collected except by authority of law. As per Article 246 of the \\nConstitution, Parliament has exclusive powers to make laws in respect of matters \\ngiven in Union List (List-I of the Seventh Schedule) and State Government has \\nthe exclusive jurisdiction to legislate on the matters containing in State List  \\n(List-II of the Seventh Schedule). In respect of the matters contained in \\nConcurrent List (List-III of the Seventh Schedule), both the Central Government \\nand State Governments have concurrent powers to legislate. \\n2.2 Before advent of GST, the most important sources of indirect tax revenue \\nfor the Union were Customs duty (entry 83 of Union List), Central Excise duty \\n(entry 84 of Union List), and Service Tax (entry 97 of Union List). Although \\nentry 92C was inserted in the Union List of the Seventh Schedule of the \\nConstitution by the Constitution (Eighty-eighth Amendment) Act, 2003 for levy \\nof taxes on services, it was not notified. So tax on services were continued to be \\nlevied under the residual entry, i.e. entry 97, of the Union List till GST came  \\ninto force. The Union also levied tax called Central Sales Tax (CST) on inter-\\nState sale and purchase of goods and on inter-State consignments of goods by \\nvirtue of entry 92A and 92B respectively. CST however is assigned to the State \\nof origin, as per Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 made under Article 269 of the \\nConstitution.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 1 \\nGST — Concept & Status  \\n3 \\n \\n2.3 On the State side, the most important sources of tax revenue were tax on \\nsale and purchase (entry 54 of the State List), excise duty on alcoholic liquors, \\nopium and narcotics (entry 51 of the State List), Taxes on luxuries, \\nentertainments, amusements, betting and gambling (entry 62 of the State List), \\noctroi or entry tax (entry 52 of the State List) and electricity tax ((entry 53 of the \\nState List). CST was also an important source of revenue though the same was \\nlevied by the Union. \\n3. Historical evolution of indirect taxation in post-independence India till \\nGST \\n3.1 In post-Independence period, Central Excise duty was levied on a few \\ncommodities which were in the nature of raw materials and intermediate inputs, \\nand consumer goods were outside the net by and large. The first set of reform \\nwas suggested by the Taxation Enquiry Commission (1953-54) under the \\nchairmanship of Dr. John Matthai. The Commission recommended that sales tax \\nshould be used specifically by the States as a source of revenue with Union \\ngovernments’ intervention allowed generally only in case of inter-State sales. It \\nalso recommended levy of a tax on inter-State sales subject to a ceiling of 1%, \\nwhich the States would administer and also retain the revenue. \\n3.2 The power to levy tax on sale and purchase of goods in the course of \\ninter-State trade and commerce was assigned to the Union by the Constitution \\n(Sixth Amendment) Act, 1956. By mid-1970s, Central Excise duty was extended \\nto most manufactured goods. Central Excise duty was levied on unit, called \\nspecific duty, and on value, called ad valorem duty. The number of rates was too \\nmany with no offsetting of taxes paid on inputs leading to significant cascading \\nand classification disputes. \\n3.3 The Indirect Taxation Enquiry Committee constituted in 1976 under Shri \\nL.K. Jha recommended, inter alia, converting specific rates into ad valorem \\nrates, rate consolidation and input tax credit mechanism of Value Added Tax at \\nManufacturing Level (MANVAT). In 1986, the recommendation of the Jha \\nCommittee on moving on to Value Added Tax in manufacturing was partially \\nimplemented. This was called Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT). In \\nprinciple, duty was payable on value addition but in the beginning it was limited \\nto select inputs and manufactured goods only with one-to-one correlation \\nbetween input and manufactured goods for eligibility to take input tax credit. The \\ncomprehensive coverage of MODVAT was achieved by 1996-97. \\n3.4 The next wave of reform in indirect tax sphere came with the New \\nEconomic Policy of 1991. The Tax Reforms Committee under the chairmanship \\nof Prof. Raja J. Chelliah was appointed in 1991. This Committee recommended \\nbroadening of the tax base by taxing services and pruning exemptions, \\nconsolidation and lowering of rates, extension of MODVAT on all inputs \\nincluding capital goods. It suggested that reform of tax structure must have to be \\naccompanied by a reform of tax administration, if complete benefits were to be \\nderived from the tax reforms. Many of the recommendations of the Chelliah \\nCommittee were implemented. In 1999-2000, tax rates were merged in three',\n",
              " '4 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 1 \\n \\nrates, with additional rates on a few luxury goods. In 2000-01, three rates were \\nmerged into one rate called Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT). A few \\ncommodities were subjected to special excise duty. \\n3.5 Taxation of services by the Union was introduced in 1994 bringing in its \\nambit only three services, namely general insurance, telecommunication and \\nstock broking. Gradually, more and more services were brought into the fold. \\nOver the next decade, more and more services were brought under the tax net. In \\n1994, tax rate on three services was 5% which gradually increased and in 2017 it \\nwas 15% (including cess). Before 2012, services were taxed under a ‘positive \\nlist’ approach. This approach was prone to ‘tax avoidance’. In 2012 budget, \\nnegative list approach was adopted where 17 services were out of taxation net \\nand all other services were subject to tax. In 2004, the input tax credit scheme for \\nCENVAT and Service Tax was merged to permit cross utilization of credits \\nacross these taxes. \\n3.6 Before state level VAT was introduced by States in the first half of the \\nfirst decade of this century, sales tax was levied in States since independence. \\nSales tax was plagued by some serious flaws. It was levied by States in an \\nuncoordinated manner the consequences of which were different rates of sales \\ntax on different commodities in different States. Rates of sales tax were more \\nthan ten in some States and these varied for the same commodity in different \\nStates. Inter-State sales were subjected to levy of Central Sales Tax. As this tax \\nwas appropriated by the exporting State credit was not allowed by the dealer in \\nthe importing State. This resulted into exportation of tax from richer to poorer \\nstates and also cascading of taxes. Interestingly, States had power of taxation \\nover services from the very beginning. States levied tax on advertisements, \\nluxuries, entertainments, amusements, betting and gambling. \\n3.7 A report, titled “Reform of Domestic Trade Taxes in India”, on reforming \\nindirect taxes, especially State sales tax, by National Institute of Public Finance \\nand Policy under the leadership of Dr. Amaresh Bagchi, was prepared in 1994. \\nThis Report prepared the ground for implementation of VAT in States. Some of \\nthe key recommendations were; replacing sales tax by VAT by moving over to a \\nmultistage system of taxation; allowing input tax credits for all inputs, including \\non machinery and equipment; harmonization and rationalization of tax rates \\nacross States with two or three rates within specified bands; pruning of \\nexemptions and concessions except for a basic threshold limit and items like \\nunprocessed food; zero rating of exports, inter-State sales and consignment \\ntransfers to registered dealers; taxing inter-State sales to non-registered persons \\nas local sales; modernization of tax administration, computerization of operations \\nand simplification of forms and procedures. \\n3.8 The first preliminary discussion on transition from sales tax regime to \\nVAT regime took place in a meeting of Chief Ministers convened by the Union \\nFinance Minister in 1995. A standing Committee of State Finance Ministers was \\nconstituted, as a result of meeting of the Union Finance Ministers and Chief \\nMinisters in November, 1999, to deliberate on the design of VAT which was',\n",
              " 'Chap. 1 \\nGST — Concept & Status  \\n5 \\n \\nlater made the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC). Haryana \\nwas the first State to implement VAT, in 2003. In 2005, VAT was implemented \\nin most of the states. Uttar Pradesh was the last State to implement VAT, from \\n1st January, 2008. \\n4. International perspectives on GST/VAT \\n4.1 VAT and GST are used inter-changeably as the latter denotes \\ncomprehensiveness of VAT by coverage of goods and services. France was the \\nfirst country to implement VAT, in 1954. Presently, more than 160 countries \\nhave implemented GST/VAT in some form or the other. The most popular form \\nof VAT is where taxes paid on inputs are allowed to be adjusted in the liability at \\nthe output. The VAT or GST regime in practice varies from one country to \\nanother in terms of its technical aspects like ‘definition of supply’, ‘extent of \\ncoverage of goods and services’, ‘treatment of exemptions and zero rating’ etc. \\nHowever, at a broader level, it has one common principle, it is a destination \\nbased consumption tax. From economic point of view, VAT is considered to be a \\nsuperior system over sales tax of taxing consumption because the former is \\nneutral in allocation of resources as it taxes value addition. Besides, there are \\ncertain distinct advantages of VAT. It is less cascading making the taxation \\nsystem transparent and anti-inflationary. From revenue point of view, VAT leads \\nto greater compliance because of creation of transaction trails. \\n4.2 When compared globally, VAT structures are either overly centralized \\nwhere tax is levied and administered by the Central government (Germany, \\nSwitzerland, Austria), or dual GST structure wherein both Centre and States \\nadminister tax independently (Canada) or with some co-ordination between the \\nnational and sub-national entities (Brazil, Russia). While a centralized structure \\nreduces fiscal autonomy for the States, a decentralized structure enhances \\ncompliance burden for the taxpayers. Canada is a federal country with unique \\nmodel of taxation in which certain provinces have joined federal GST and others \\nhave not. Provinces which administer their taxes separately are called ‘non-\\nparticipating provinces’, whereas provinces which have teamed up with the \\nFederal Government for tax administration are called ‘participating provinces’. \\n4.3 The rate of GST varies across countries. While Malaysia has a lower rate \\nof 6% (Malaysia though scrapped GST in 2018 due to popular uproar against it), \\nHungary has one of the highest rate of 27%. Australia levies GST at the rate of \\n10% whereas Canada has multiple rate slabs. The average rate of VAT across the \\nEU is around 19.5%. \\n5. Need for GST in India \\n5.1 The introduction of CENVAT removed to a great extent cascading \\nburden by expanding the coverage of credit for all inputs, including capital \\ngoods. CENVAT scheme later also allowed credit of services and the basket of \\ninputs, capital goods and input services could be used for payment of both \\nCentral Excise duty and service tax. Similarly, the introduction of VAT in the \\nStates has removed the cascading effect by giving set-off for tax paid on inputs as',\n",
              " '6 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 1 \\n \\nwell as tax paid on previous purchases and has again been an improvement over \\nthe previous sales tax regime. \\n5.2 But both the CENVAT and the State VAT have certain incompleteness. \\nThe incompleteness in CENVAT is that it has yet not been extended to include \\nchain of value addition in the distributive trade below the stage of production. \\nSimilarly, in the State-level VAT, CENVAT load on the goods has not yet been \\nremoved and the cascading effect of that part of tax burden has remained \\nunrelieved. Moreover, there are several taxes in the States, such as, Luxury Tax, \\nEntertainment Tax, etc. which have still not been subsumed in the VAT. Further, \\nthere has also not been any integration of VAT on goods with tax on services at \\nthe State level with removal of cascading effect of service tax. \\n5.3 CST was another source of distortion in terms of its cascading nature. It \\nwas also against one of the basic principles of consumption taxes that tax should \\naccrue to the jurisdiction where consumption takes place. Despite remarkable \\nharmonization in VAT regimes under the auspices of the EC, the national market \\nwas fragmented with too many obstacles in free movement of goods necessitated \\nby procedural requirement under VAT and CST. \\n5.4 In the constitutional scheme, taxation powers on goods was with Central \\nGovernment but it was limited up to the stage of manufacture and production \\nwhile States have powers to tax sale and purchase of goods. Centre had powers to \\ntax services and States also had powers to tax certain services specified in clause \\n(29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution. This sort of division of taxing powers \\ncreated a grey zone which led to legal disputes. Determination of what \\nconstitutes a goods or service is difficult because in modern complex system of \\nproduction, a product is normally a mixture of goods and services. \\n5.5 As can be seen from the previous paragraphs, India moved towards value \\nadded taxation both at Central and State level, and this process was complete by \\n2005. Integration of Central VAT and State VAT therefore is nothing but an \\ninevitable consequence of the reform process. The Constitution of India \\nenvisages a federal nature of power bestowed upon both Union and States in the \\nConstitution itself. As a natural corollary of this, any unification of the taxation \\nsystem required a dual GST, levied and collected both by the Union and the \\nStates. \\n6. GST: A historical perspective \\n6.1 The Kelkar Task Force on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management \\n(FRBM) recommended in 2005 introduction of a comprehensive tax on all goods \\nand service replacing Central level VAT and State level VATs. It recommended \\nreplacing all indirect taxes except the Customs duty with Value Added Tax on all \\ngoods and services with complete set off in all stages of making of a product. \\n6.2 In the year 2000, the then Prime Minister introduced the concept of GST \\nand set up a committee to design a GST model for the country. In 2003, the \\nCentral Government formed a taskforce on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget \\nManagement, which in 2004 recommended GST to replace the existing tax',\n",
              " 'Chap. 1 \\nGST — Concept & Status  \\n7 \\n \\nregime by introducing a comprehensive tax on all goods and services replacing \\nCentral level VAT and State level VATs. It recommended replacing all indirect \\ntaxes except the Customs duty with Value Added Tax on all goods and services \\nwith complete set off in all stages of the value chain. An announcement was \\nmade by the then Union Finance Minister in Budget (2006-07) to the effect that \\nGST would be introduced with effect from April 1, 2010 and that the EC, on his \\nrequest, would work with the Central Government to prepare a road map for \\nintroduction of GST in India. After this announcement, the EC decided to set up \\na Joint Working Group in May 10, 2007, with the then Adviser to the Union \\nFinance Minister and Member-Secretary of the Empowered Committee as its Co-\\nconveners and four Joint Secretaries of the Department of Revenue of Union \\nFinance Ministry and all Finance Secretaries of the States as its members. This \\nJoint Working Group got itself divided into three Sub-Groups and had several \\nrounds of internal discussions as well as interaction with experts and \\nrepresentatives of Chambers of Commerce & Industry. On the basis of these \\ndiscussions and interaction, the Sub-Groups submitted their reports which were \\nthen integrated and consolidated into the report of Joint Working Group \\n(November 19, 2007). \\n6.3 This report was discussed in detail in the meeting of the EC on November \\n28, 2007, and the States were also requested to communicate their observations \\non the report in writing. On the basis of these discussions in the EC and the \\nwritten observations, certain modifications were considered necessary and were \\ndiscussed with the Co-conveners and the representatives of the Department of \\nRevenue of Union Finance Ministry. With the modifications duly made, a final \\nversion of the views of EC on the model and road map for the GST was prepared \\n(April 30, 2008). These views of EC were then sent to the Government of India, \\nand the comments of Government of India were received on December 12, 2008. \\nThese comments were duly considered by the EC (December 16, 2008), and it \\nwas decided that a Committee of Principal Secretaries/Secretaries of \\nFinance/Taxation and Commissioners of Trade Taxes of the States would be set \\nup to consider these comments, and submit their views. These views were \\nsubmitted and were accepted in principle by the EC (January 21, 2009). Based on \\ndiscussions within the EC and between the EC and the Central Government, the \\nEC released its First Discussion Paper (FDP) on GST in November, 2009. This \\nspelled out the features of the proposed GST and has formed the basis for \\ndiscussion between the Centre and the States. \\n7. Challenges in designing GST \\n7.1 In the discussion that preceded amendment in the Constitution for GST, \\nthere were a number of thorny issues that required resolution and agreement \\nbetween Central Government and State Governments. Implementing a tax reform \\nas vast as GST in a diverse country like India required the reconciliation of \\ninterests of various States with that of the Centre. Some of the challenging issues, \\naddressed in the run up to GST, were the following:',\n",
              " '8 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 1 \\n \\n7.2 Origin-based versus Destination-based taxation \\nGST is a destination based consumption tax. Under destination based \\ntaxation, tax accrues to the destination place where consumption of the goods or \\nservices takes place. The earlier VAT regime was based on origin principle \\nwhere Central Sales Tax was assigned to the State of origin where production or \\nsale happened and not to the State where consumption happened. Many \\nmanufacturing States expressed concerns over the loss of revenue on account of \\nshift from origin based taxation to destination based taxation. \\n7.3 An argument put forward on behalf of producing states in support of \\norigin based taxation is that they need to collect at least some tax from inter-State \\nsales in order to recover the cost of infrastructure and public services provided by \\nthe State Governments to the industries producing the goods which are consumed \\nin other states. This line of reasoning is based on the assumption that in the \\nabsence of a tax on inter-State sales, the location of export industries within their \\njurisdiction would not contribute to the tax revenues of the exporting state. This \\nview was missing the fact that any value addition in a jurisdiction necessarily \\nmeans extra income in the hands of the residents of that jurisdiction. Spending of \\nthis income on consumer goods expands the sales tax base of the producing states \\nand thereby contributes to their revenues. In fact, to the extent that consumer \\nexpenditures are dependent on the level of income of the residents of a State, it is \\nthe producing States that stand to gain the most in additional sales tax revenues \\n(even under the destination basis of consumption taxes) from increased export \\noutput. \\n7.4 Rate Structure and Compensation \\nThere was uncertainty about gains in revenue after implementation of GST. \\nThough attempts were made to estimate a revenue neutral rate, nonetheless it \\nremains an estimate only. It was difficult to estimate accurately as to how much \\nthe States will gain from tax on services and how much they will lose on account \\nof removal of cascading effect and phasing out of CST. In view of this, States \\nasked for compensation during the first five years of implementation of GST. \\n7.5 A Committee headed by the Chief Economic Adviser Dr. Arvind \\nSubramanian on possible tax rates under GST suggested RNR (Revenue Neutral \\nRate). The term RNR refers to that single rate, which preserves revenue at \\ndesired (current) levels. This would differ from the standard rate, which is the \\nrate that would apply to a majority of goods and services. In practice, there will \\nbe a structure of rates, but for the sake of analytical clarity and precision it is \\nappropriate to think of the RNR as a single rate. It is a given single rate that gets \\nconverted into a whole rate structure, depending on policy choices about \\nexemptions, what commodities to charge at a lower rate and what to charge at a \\nvery high rate. \\n7.6 The Committee recommended RNR of 15-15.5% (to be levied by the \\nCentre and States combined). The lower rates (to be applied to certain goods',\n",
              " 'Chap. 1 \\nGST — Concept & Status  \\n9 \\n \\nconsumed by the poor) should be 12%. Further, the sin or demerit rates (to be \\napplied on luxury cars, aerated beverages, pan masala, and tobacco) should be \\n40%. \\n8. Dispute Settlement \\nA harmonized system of taxation necessarily required that all stakeholders \\nstick to the decisions taken by the supreme body, which was later constituted as \\nthe Goods and Services Tax Council (the Council). However, the possibility of \\ndeparture from the recommendations of such body cannot be completely ruled \\nout. Any departure would definitely affect other stakeholders and in such \\ncircumstances there must be a statutory body to which affected parties may \\napproach for dispute resolution. The nature of such dispute resolution body was a \\nbone of contention. Under the Constitution (One Hundred Fifteenth Amendment) \\nBill, 2011, a Goods and Services Tax Dispute Settlement Authority was to be \\nconstituted for this purpose. This body was judicial in nature. The proposed \\nconstitution of this Authority was challenged because its powers would override \\nthe supremacy of the Parliament and the State Legislatures. The Constitution \\n(One Hundred Twenty Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 departed from the \\nprevious GST amendment bill and proposed that the Goods and Services Tax \\nCouncil may decide about the modalities to resolve disputes arising out of its \\nrecommendations. \\n9. Alcohol and Petroleum products \\nAlcoholic liquor for human consumption and petroleum products are major \\ncontributor to revenue of States. As States were uncertain about impact of GST \\non their finances and moreover loss of autonomy in collection of tax revenue, \\nStates unanimously argued for exclusion of these products from the ambit of \\nGST. In the 115th Amendment Bill alcoholic liquor for human consumption and \\nfive petroleum products namely crude petroleum, high speed diesel, motor spirit \\nor petrol, aviation turbine fuel and natural gas were kept out of GST. But in the \\n122nd Amendment Bill, only alcoholic liquor for human consumption was kept \\noutside GST and above mentioned five petroleum products were proposed to be \\nbrought under GST from a date to be recommended by the Council. The Central \\nGovernment has also retained its power to tax tobacco and tobacco products, \\nthough these are also under GST. Thus, to ensure smooth transition and provide \\nfiscal buffer to States, it was agreed to keep alcohol completely out of the ambit \\nof GST. \\n10. Constitutional amendment \\n10.1 As explained above, unification of Central VAT and State VAT was \\npossible in form of a dual levy under the constitutional scheme. Power of \\ntaxation is assigned to either Union or States subject-wise under Schedule VII of \\nthe Constitution. While the Centre is empowered to tax goods up to the \\nproduction or manufacturing stage, the States have the power to tax goods at \\ndistribution stage. The Union can tax services using residuary powers but States \\ncould not. Under a unified Goods and Services Tax scheme, both should have \\npower to tax the complete supply chain from production to distribution, and both',\n",
              " '10 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 1 \\n \\ngoods and services. The scheme of the Constitution did not provide for any \\nconcurrent taxing powers to the Union as well as the States and for the purpose \\nof introducing goods and services tax amendment of the Constitution conferring \\nsimultaneous power on Parliament as well as the State Legislatures to make laws \\nfor levying goods and services tax on every transaction of supply of goods or \\nservices was necessary. \\n10.2 The Constitution (115th Amendment) Bill, 2011, in relation to the \\nintroduction of GST, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 11-3-2011. The Bill \\nwas referred to the Standing Committee on Finance on 29-3-2011. The Standing \\nCommittee submitted its report on the Bill in August, 2013. However, the Bill, \\nwhich was pending in the Lok Sabha, lapsed with the dissolution of the 15th Lok \\nSabha. \\n10.3 The Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014 was introduced in the \\n16th Lok Sabha on 19-12-2014. The Constitution Amendment Bill was passed by \\nthe Lok Sabha in May, 2015. The Bill was referred to the Select Committee of \\nRajya Sabha on 12-5-2015. The Select Committee submitted its Report on the \\nBill on 22-7-2015. The Bill with certain amendments was finally passed in the \\nRajya Sabha and thereafter by Lok Sabha in August, 2016. Further the bill was \\nratified by required number of States and received assent of the President on 8th \\nSeptember, 2016 and has since been enacted as Constitution (101st Amendment) \\nAct, 2016 w.e.f. 16-9-2016. \\n11. The important changes introduced in the Constitution by the 101st \\nAmendment Act are the following \\n \\n(a) Insertion of new Article 246A which makes enabling provisions for the \\nUnion and States with respect to the GST legislation. It further specifies \\nthat Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to GST \\non inter-State supplies. \\n \\n(b) Article 268A of the Constitution has been omitted. The said article \\nempowered the Government of India to levy taxes on services. As tax on \\nservices has been brought under GST, such a provision was no longer \\nrequired. \\n \\n(c) Article 269A has been inserted which provides for goods and services \\ntax on supplies in the course of inter-State trade or commerce which shall \\nbe levied and collected by the Government of India and such tax shall be \\napportioned between the Union and the States in the manner as may be \\nprovided by Parliament by law on the recommendations of the Goods \\nand Services Tax Council. It also provides that Parliament may, by law, \\nformulate the principles for determining the place of supply, and when a \\nsupply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in the course of inter-\\nState trade or commerce. \\n \\n(d) Article 270 has been amended to provide for distribution of goods and \\nServices Tax collected by the Union between the Union and the States.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 1 \\nGST — Concept & Status  \\n11 \\n \\n \\n(e)  Article 271 has been amended which restricts power of the Parliament to \\nlevy surcharge under GST.

This happened in spite of the \\navailability of the tax credit. This was happening because the supplier was not \\npassing on the benefit to the consumer and thereby indulging in illegal \\nprofiteering.

This apart, the CBIC has prepared itself for meeting the \\nimplementation challenges, which are quite formidable. The number of taxpayers \\nhas gone up significantly. The existing IT infrastructure of CBIC has been \\nsuitably scaled up to handle such large volumes of data. Based on the legal \\nprovisions and procedure for GST, the content of work-flow software such as \\nACES (Automated Central Excise & Service Tax) would require re-engineering. \\nThe name of IT project of CBIC under GST is ‘SAKSHAM’ involving a total \\nproject value of `2,256 Cr. \\n26.31 Augmentation of human resources would be necessary to handle large \\ntaxpayers’ base in GST scattered across the length and breadth of the country. \\nCapacity building, particularly in the field of Accountancy and Information \\nTechnology for the departmental officers has to be taken up in a big way. A \\nmassive four-tier training programme has been conducted under the leadership of \\nNACIN. This training project is aimed at imparting training on GST law and \\nprocedures to more than 60,000 officers of CBIC and Commercial Tax officers \\nof State Governments. \\n26.32 CBIC would be responsible for administration of the CGST and IGST \\nlaw. In addition, excise duty regime would continue to be administered by the \\nCBIC for levy and collection of Central Excise duty on five specified petroleum \\nproducts as well as on tobacco products.

Goods & Services Tax Network \\n27.1 Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) has been set up by the \\nGovernment as a private company under erstwhile Section 25 of the Companies \\nAct, 1956. GSTN would provide three front end services to the taxpayers namely \\nregistration, payment and return. Besides providing these services to the \\ntaxpayers, GSTN would be developing back-end IT modules for 27 States who \\nhave opted for the same. Infosys has been appointed as Managed Service \\nProvider (MSP). GSTN has selected 73 IT, ITeS and financial technology \\ncompanies and 1 Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (CCT, Karnataka), to be \\ncalled GST Suvidha Providers (GSPs). GSPs would develop applications to be \\nused by taxpayers for interacting with the GSTN. \\n27.2 The Central Government holds 24.5 per cent stake in GSTN while the \\nstate government holds 24.5 per cent. The remaining 51 per cent are held by non-\\nGovernment financial institutions, HDFC and HDFC Bank hold 20%, ICICI \\nBank holds 10%, NSE Strategic Investment holds 10% and LIC Housing Finance \\nholds 10%. The GST Council in its 27th meeting held on 4-5-2018 has approved \\nthe change in shareholding pattern of GSTN. Considering the nature of ‘state’ \\nfunction’ performed by GSTN, the GST Council felt that GSTN be converted \\ninto a fully owned Government company. Accordingly, the Council approved \\nacquisition of entire 51 per cent of equity held by non-Governmental institutions \\nin GSTN amounting to `5.1 crore, equally by the Centre and the State \\nGovernments. \\n27.3 The design of GST systems is based on role based access. The taxpayer \\ncan access his own data through identified applications like registration, return, \\nview ledger etc. The tax official having jurisdiction, as per GST law, can access \\nthe data. Data can be accessed by audit authorities as per law. No other entity can \\nhave any access to data available with GSTN. \\n28. GST: A game changer for Indian economy \\n28.1 GST will have a multiplier effect on the economy with benefits accruing \\nto various sectors as discussed below. \\n28.2 Benefits to the exporters: \\nThe subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and \\ncomprehensive setoff of input goods and services and phasing out of Central \\nSales Tax (CST) would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and \\nservices. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in \\nthe international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax \\nrates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the \\ncompliance cost. \\n28.3 Benefits to small traders and entrepreneurs:  \\nGST has increased the threshold for GST registration for small businesses. \\nThose units having aggregate annual turnover more than `20 lakhs (`10 lakhs in \\ncertain cases) in case of supplier of services and `40 lakhs (`20 lakhs in certain \\ncases) in case of supplier of goods have be registered under GST. Unlike multiple \\nregistrations under different tax regimes earlier, a single registration is needed',\n",
              " '32 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 1 \\n \\nunder GST in one State. An additional benefit under Composition scheme has \\nalso been provided for businesses with aggregate annual turnover up to `1.5 \\ncrore (`75 lakhs in certain cases) in case of supplier of goods and restaurant \\nservices and `50 lakhs in case of supplier of services. With the creation of a \\nseamless national market across the country, small enterprises will have an \\nopportunity to expand their national footprint with minimal investment. \\n28.4 Benefits to agriculture and Industry:   \\nGST will give more relief to industry, trade and agriculture through a more \\ncomprehensive and wider coverage of input tax set-off and service tax set-off, \\nsubsuming of several Central and State taxes in the GST and phasing out of CST. \\nThe transparent and complete chain of set-offs which will result in widening of \\ntax base and better tax compliance may also lead to lowering of tax burden on an \\naverage dealer in industry, trade and agriculture. \\n28.5 Benefits for common consumers:  \\nWith the introduction of GST, the cascading effects of CENVAT, State VAT \\nand service tax will be more comprehensively removed with a continuous chain \\nof set-off from the producer’s point to the retailer’s point than what was possible \\nunder the prevailing CENVAT and VAT regime. Certain major Central and State \\ntaxes will also be subsumed in GST and CST will be phased out. Other things \\nremaining the same, the burden of tax on goods would, in general, fall under \\nGST and that would benefit the consumers. \\n29. Promote “Make in India” \\nGST will help to create a unified common national market for India, giving a \\nboost to foreign investment and “Make in India” campaign. It will prevent \\ncascading of taxes and make products cheaper, thus boosting aggregate demand. \\nIt will result in harmonization of laws, procedures and rates of tax. It will boost \\nexport and manufacturing activity, generate more employment and thus increase \\nGDP with gainful employment leading to substantive economic growth. \\nUltimately it will help in poverty eradication by generating more employment \\nand more financial resources. More efficient neutralization of taxes especially for \\nexports thereby making our products more competitive in the international \\nmarket and give boost to Indian Exports. It will also improve the overall \\ninvestment climate in the country which will naturally benefit the development in \\nthe states. Uniform CGST & SGST and IGST rates will reduce the incentive for \\nevasion by eliminating rate arbitrage between neighbouring States and that \\nbetween intra and inter-State supplies. Average tax burden on companies is likely \\nto come down which is expected to reduce prices and lower prices mean more \\nconsumption, which in turn means more production thereby helping in the \\ngrowth of the industries. This will create India as a “Manufacturing hub”. \\n29.1 Ease of Doing Business \\nSimpler tax regime with fewer exemptions along with reduction in \\nmultiplicity of taxes that are at present governing our indirect tax system will \\nlead to simplification and uniformity. Reduction in compliance costs as multiple \\nrecord-keeping for a variety of taxes will not be needed, therefore, lesser',\n",
              " 'Chap. 1 \\nGST — Concept & Status  \\n33 \\n \\ninvestment of resources and manpower in maintaining records. It will result in \\nsimplified and automated procedures for various processes such as registration, \\nreturns, refunds, tax payments. All interaction shall be through the common \\nGSTN portal, therefore, less public interface between the taxpayer and the tax \\nadministration. It will improve environment of compliance as all returns to be \\nfiled online, input credits to be verified online, encouraging more paper trail of \\ntransactions. Common procedures for registration of taxpayers, refund of taxes, \\nuniform formats of tax return, common tax base, common system of \\nclassification of goods and services will lend greater certainty to taxation system. \\n30. Challenges & future ahead \\n30.1 Any new change is accompanied by difficulties and problems at the \\noutset. A change as comprehensive as GST is bound to pose certain challenges \\nnot only for the government but also for business community, tax administration \\nand even common citizens of the country. Some of these challenges relate to the \\nunfamiliarity with the new regime and IT systems, legal challenges, return filing \\nand reconciliations, passing on transition credit. Lack of robust IT infrastructure \\nand system delays makes compliance difficult for the taxpayers. Many of the \\nprocesses in the GST are new for small and medium enterprises in particular, \\nwho were not used to regular and online filing of returns and other formalities. \\n30.2 Based on the feedback received from businesses, consumers and \\ntaxpayers from across the country, attempt has been made to incorporate \\nsuggestions and reduce problems through short-term as well as long-term \\nsolutions. After rectifying system glitches, E-way bill for inter-State movement \\nof goods has been successfully implemented from 1-4-2018. As regards intra-\\nState supplies, option was given to States to choose any date on or before  \\n3-6-2018. All States have notified e-way bill rules for intra-State supplies last \\nbeing NCT of Delhi where it was introduced w.e.f. 16-6-2018. A total of 37.12 \\ncrore e-way bills for inter-State movement and 3.17 crore for intra-State \\nmovement have been generated till 31-5-2019. \\n30.3 NAA has initiated investigation into various complaints of anti-\\nprofiteering and has passed orders in some cases to protect consumer interest. \\n30.4 To expedite sanction of refund, electronic filing of refunds, along with \\nall supporting documents/invoices, has been enabled on the common portal. \\nClarificatory Circulars and notifications have been issued to guide field \\nformations of CBIC and States in this regard. The government has put in place an \\nIT grievance redressal mechanism to address the difficulties faced by taxpayers \\nowing to technical glitches on the GST portal. \\n30.5 The introduction of GST is truly a game changer for Indian economy as \\nit has replaced multi-layered, complex indirect tax structure with a simple, \\ntransparent and technology-driven tax regime. It has integrated India into a \\nsingle, common market by breaking barriers to inter-State trade and commerce. \\nBy eliminating cascading of taxes and reducing transaction costs, it will enhance \\nease of doing business in the country and provide an impetus to —Make in India” \\ncampaign. GST will result in “ONE NATION, ONE TAX, ONE MARKET”. \\n*******',\n",

Taxable event under GST \\nThe earlier concept of taxable event, “manufacture”, has been replaced with \\nconcept of taxable event “supply” and the term manufacture has no relevant \\nunder the GST regime. The taxable event under GST is the “supply of goods or \\nservices” or both made for consideration in the course or furtherance of business. \\nThe taxable events under the earlier indirect tax laws, such as manufacture, sale, \\nor provision of services stand subsumed in the present taxable event known as \\n‘supply’. Therefore, the concept supply has occupied key place and the vital \\nevent in determining the taxability of all transaction whether commercial or \\notherwise under the GST regime. \\n2. Meaning of GST \\nThe Constitution defines “Goods and Services Tax” as “any tax on supply of \\ngoods or services or both except tax on supply of alcoholic liquor for human \\nconsumption [Article 366(12A) of the Constitutional (101st Amendment) Act, \\n2016]”.',\n",

              " 'Chap. 3 \\nLevy and Collection of Tax \\n47 \\n7. Taxable Supply \\nSection 2(108) of the CGST Act, defines ‘taxable supply’ means a supply of \\ngoods or services or both which is leviable to tax under this Act. \\nFor a supply to attract GST, the supply must be taxable. Taxable supply has \\nbeen broadly defined and means any supply of goods or services or both which, \\nis leviable to tax under the Act. Exemptions may be provided to the specified \\ngoods or services or to a specified category of persons/entities making supply. \\n8. Taxable Person \\nA supply to attract GST should be made by a taxable person. Hence, a supply \\nbetween two non-taxable persons does not constitute supply under GST. A \\n“taxable person” is a person who is registered or liable to be registered under \\nSection 22 or Section 24. Hence, even an unregistered person who is liable to be \\nregistered is a taxable person. Similarly, a person not liable to be registered but \\nhas taken voluntary registration and got himself registered is also a taxable \\nperson. \\nIt should be noted that GST in India is State-centric. Hence, a person making \\nsupplies from different States needs to take separate registration in each State. \\nFurther, the person may take more than one registration within a State if the \\nperson has multiple business verticals. A person who has obtained or is required \\nto obtain more than one registration, whether in one State or Union territory or \\nmore than one State or Union territory shall, in respect of each such registration, \\nbe treated as distinct persons for the purposes of GST. Hence, a supply between \\nthese entities constitutes supply under GST. \\n9. Supply in the Taxable Territory \\nFor a supply to attract GST, the place of supply should be in India except for \\nthe State of Jammu and Kashmir. The place of supply of any goods or services is \\ndetermined based on Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 of IGST Act, 2017. \\n10. Inter/Intra-State Supply \\nThe location of the supplier and the place of supply determines whether a \\nsupply is treated as an intra-State supply or an inter-State supply. Determination \\nof the nature of supply is essential to ascertain whether Integrated tax is to be \\npaid or Central plus State taxes are to be paid. Inter-State supply of goods means \\na supply of goods where the location of the supplier and place of supply are in \\ndifferent States or Union territories. Intra-State supply of goods means supply of \\ngoods where the location of the supplier and the place of supply are in the same \\nState or Union territory. Imports, Supplies from and to SEZs are treated as \\ndeemed Inter-State supplies. \\n11. Tax liability on composite and mixed supplies \\nSection 8 of the CGST Act, defines the tax liability on a composite or a \\nmixed supply shall be determined in the following manner, namely - \\n(a) Composite Supply comprising two or more supplies one of which, is a \\nprincipal supply, shall be treated as supply of such principal supply. \\n(b) Mixed Supply comprising two or more supplies, shall be treated as \\nsupply of that particular supply which attracts the highest rate of tax.',\n",

Principal Supply \\nSection 2(90) of the CGST Act, defines ‘principal supply’ means the supply \\nof goods or services which constitutes the predominant element of a composite \\nsupply and to which any other supply forming part of that composite supply is \\nancillary. \\n13. Exempt supply \\nSection 2(47) of the CGST Act, defines ‘exempt supply’ means supply of \\nany goods or services or both which attracts nil rate of tax or which may be \\nwholly exempt from tax under Section 11 or under Section 6 of the Integrated \\nGoods and Services Tax Act, and includes non-taxable supply. \\n14. Non-taxable supply \\nSection 2(78) of the CGST Act, defines ‘non-taxable supply’ means a supply \\nof goods or services or both which is not taxable under this Act or under the \\nIntegrated Goods and Services Tax Act. \\n15. Zero-rated supply \\nSection 16 of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, defines ‘zero-rated \\nsupply’ means any of the following supplies of goods or services or both, \\nnamely— \\n(a) export of goods or services or both, or \\n(b) supply of goods or services or both to a Special Economic Zone or \\ndeveloper of a Special Economic Zone. \\n16.

However clause 2 of \\nArticle 246A read with Article 269A provides exclusive power to parliament to \\nlegislate with respect to inter-state trade or commerce. Therefore, the Central and \\nState Governments will have simultaneous powers to levy the GST on intra-State \\nsupply.

The concept of “composite supply” under GST is similar to the concept of \\n“bundled service” was under erstwhile Service Tax Law. The concept of mixed \\nsupply is completely new provision under GST. \\n39. Concept of “Bundled service” in pre-GST era \\nThe concept of Bundled service was brought as Rule of interpretation for \\ncharging Service Tax in the Union Budget-2012. There are two kinds of bundled \\nservice explained as under: \\nA. Naturally bundled:- \\n> \\nMeals and air/rail travel: air travel \\n> \\nBreakfast and hotel accommodation: hotel accommodation \\n> \\nBoarding school: education. \\nB. Unnatural bundles:- \\n> \\nUnnaturally segregated: Dry cleaning billed as electricity, chemicals, \\nironing. \\n> \\nUnnaturally joined: Construction and club membership. \\n40. Tax liability on ‘composite’ and ‘mixed’ supplies \\nSection 8 of the CGST Act, defines the tax liability on a composite or a \\nmixed supply shall be determined in the following manner, namely— \\n(a) Composite Supply comprising two or more supplies one of which, is a \\nprincipal supply, shall be treated as supply of such principal supply. \\n(b) Mixed Supply comprising two or more supplies, shall be treated as \\nsupply of that particular supply which attracts the highest rate of tax. \\n41. Determination of a Composite supply and rate of tax \\nA supply of goods and services will be treated as composite supply when the \\nsupply is a combination of two more goods or services, it is a natural bundle i.e. \\ngoods or services are usually provided together in the normal course of business. \\nThey cannot be separated. The tax rate of the principal supply will apply on the \\nentire supply. \\nIllustration \\nA star hotel for accommodation and along with accommodation provides, \\nentertainment TV channels, facility to use swimming pool, reading news papers, \\nmagazines, Telephone connectivity, laundry/dry cleaning of clothes. This is a \\nnatural bundling of supply of services in the ordinary course of business. The \\nsupply service of hotel accommodation gives the bundle the essential character \\nand would, therefore, be treated as supply of service of providing hotel \\naccommodation. Thus, the principal supply of services is Hotel accommodation. \\n42. Determination of a mixed supply and rate of tax \\nMixed supply means a combination of two or more goods or services made \\ntogether for a single price. Each of these items can be supplied separately and is \\nnot dependent on any other item. The Rate of tax will have to be charged of the \\nitem which is highest rate of tax.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 3 \\nLevy and Collection of Tax \\n61 \\nIllustration \\nA Diwali gift packet consisting of canned foods, sweets, chocolates, cakes, \\ndry fruits, aerated drinks and fruit juices supplied for a single price is a mixed \\nsupply. All are also sold separately. Since aerated drinks have the highest GST \\nrate of 28%. Thereby, aerated drinks will be treated as principal and 28% will \\napply on the entire gift packet. \\nIf a person buys all the items namely, canned foods sweets, chocolates, \\ncakes, dry fruits, aerated drinks and fruit juices separately and it cannot be \\nconsidered as Diwali gift packet. Then it is not considered as a mixed supply. All \\nitems will be taxed separately.  \\n43. Time of supply in case of composite supply \\nIf the principal supply is a service for example, catering on board and \\ntransport by air is a composite supply offered by a majority of airlines. Then \\ncomposite supply will be treated as a supply of services. The provisions relating \\nto time of supply of services will apply. \\nSimilarly, in the case of purchasing goods and transporting the goods, the \\nsupply of goods is the principal supply. The composite supply will qualify as \\nsupply of goods and the provisions relating to time of supply of goods will apply. \\nA works contract is consisting of supply of service and supply of goods. For \\nexample, construction of a new building where a combination of materials like \\nbricks, sand, cement along with services of labourers, engineers, carpenters, \\narchitects etc., for making a building (goods). It is a unique example of both \\nsupply of goods and supply of services. But the GST law maker has considered \\nworks contract as a supply of service with specific rates to overcome the \\nlitigation under earlier tax law. \\n44. Time of supply in case of mixed supply \\nIf the highest tax rate belongs to a service then the mixed supply will be \\ntreated as the supply of services. The provision relating to time of supply of \\nservices would be applicable.  \\nSimilarly, if the highest tax rate belongs to goods then the mixed supply will \\nbe treated as supply of goods. The provisions relating to time of supply of goods \\nwould be applicable. \\n45.

Principal supply has been defined in Section 2(90) of the Central Goods \\nand Services Tax Act as supply of goods or services which constitutes the \\npredominant element of a composite supply and to which any other supply \\nforming part of that composite supply is ancillary. \\n4. In the case of printing of books, pamphlets, brochures, annual reports, and \\nthe like, where only content is supplied by the publisher or the person who owns \\nthe usage rights to the intangible inputs while the physical inputs including paper \\nused for printing belong to the printer, supply of printing of the content supplied \\nby the recipient of supply is the principal supply and therefore such supplies \\nwould constitute supply of service falling under Heading 9989 of the scheme of \\nclassification of services. \\n5. In case of supply of printed envelopes, letter cards, printed boxes, tissues, \\nnapkins, wall paper etc. falling under Chapter 48 or 49, printed with design, logo \\netc. supplied by the recipient of goods but made using physical inputs including \\npaper belonging to the printer, predominant supply is that of goods and the \\nsupply of printing of the content supplied by the recipient of supply is ancillary to \\nthe principal supply of goods and therefore such supplies would constitute supply \\nof goods falling under respective headings of Chapter 48 or 49 of the Customs \\nTariff. \\nC.B.I & C Clarification regarding exercise of option to pay tax under notification \\nNo. 2/2019-C.T.

Exclusion of discounts  \\nDiscounts like trade discount, quantity discount etc, are part of the normal \\ntrade and commerce. Therefore, pre-supply discounts i.e. discounts recorded in \\nthe invoice have been allowed to be excluded while determining the taxable \\nvalue. \\nDiscounts provided after the supply can also be excluded while determining \\nthe taxable value, provided two conditions are met, namely: \\n(a) discounts is established in terms of a pre supply agreement between the \\nsupplier & the recipient and such discount is linked to relevant invoices.  \\n(b) Input Tax Credit attributable to the discounts is reversed by the recipient.',\n",

It is \\neligible for volume discount for sales and purchase of such vehicles on achieving \\nthe target. It has sought an Advance Ruling to determine the applicability of GST \\non the volume discount received on purchase and sales of vehicles. \\nThe Authority for Advance Rulings observed that the authorised dealer is \\nissuing a tax invoice on supply of goods to the applicant on the basis of which \\napplicant takes the ITC. The applicant is eligible for volume discount on \\npurchases and sales made above the target specified for which a credit note is \\nissued by the authorised dealer which neither adjusts price of goods already sold \\nnor adjusts GST amount. The applicant is also not reducing ITC already claimed \\nby it as it does not affect the price of goods sold. \\nAs per GST provisions, discount given after the supply shall not be included \\nin the value of supply if such discount is established in terms of an agreement \\nbefore or at the time of supply and linked to relevant invoices. Further, the ITC \\nattributable to discount on basis of document issued by supplier has to be \\nreversed by the recipient. Since the credit note is issued as post-sale event and \\napplicant has not reversed ITC attributable to discount received in the form of \\ncredit note, the criteria given under GST Act to exclude discount from value of \\nsupply are not fulfilled. In the given case, credit note issued by the dealer does \\nnot have any effect on the value of supply and is only a financial document for \\naccounts adjustment for the incentive provided. Hence, there is no effect of GST. \\nTherefore, volume discount received on purchase and sales in the form of credit \\nnotes without any adjustment of GST is not liable for GST. \\n* \\n* \\n* \\nTools supplied by OEM to Component manufacturer for free not to be \\nadded to value of component: AAR-Karnataka. \\nIn Re: Toolcomp System (P.)

The details of the address of prin-\\ncipal and additional places of business and the corresponding documents upload-\\ned with the application as proof of address may be closely scrutinised to verify \\ncompleteness and correctness of address of such places of business. Further, to \\nthe extent possible, the authenticity of the documents furnished as proof of ad-\\ndress may be cross-verified from the publicly available sources, such as websites \\nof the concerned authorities such as land registry, electricity distribution compa-\\nnies, municipalities, and local bodies, etc. \\n5.3 In order to facilitate targeted approach in verification and processing of \\nregistration applications, the Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Manage-\\nment (DGARM), in coordination with GSTN, is conducting risk rating of the \\napplications for registration in form of High, Medium and Low risk rating for \\neach application for registration (ARN), based on data analytics and risk parame-\\nters, and making the same available to the CGST field formations in the form of \\nReport Series 400 on DDM portal on regular basis. Accordingly, the proper of-\\nficer shall check the said risk rating made available by the DGARM in respect of \\nthe concerned ARN and take the same into consideration while verifying and \\nprocessing the said application. Special attention needs to be paid to the cases \\nwhere “High” risk rating has been assigned to an ARN. \\n5.4 The proper officer may also check as to whether the registration(s) has \\nbeen obtained on the same PAN earlier, either within the same State or other \\nState(s). In such cases, the status of the said PAN as well as the compliance rec-\\nord of the said GSTINs may also be checked from the portal. The proper officer \\nmay also give due consideration and special attention to the cases involving inter \\nalia the following circumstances: (i) where any registration obtained on the PAN \\nof the applicant has been cancelled previously; (ii) where any registration ob-\\ntained on the PAN of the applicant is suspended at the time of verification of a',\n",

In such cases, the supplier \\nwill not be fulfilling the condition specified in S. No. 4 of the Circular No. \\n156/12/2021 dated 21st June 2021, and accordingly, will be required to have \\ndynamic QR code on the invoice. It has been also represented that relaxation \\nfrom dynamic QR code on the invoices in such cases should be available if the \\npayment is received through any RBI approved mode of payment, and not \\nnecessarily in foreign exchange. \\n2. The issues have been examined and in order to ensure uniformity in the \\nimplementation of the provisions of the law across the field formations, the \\nBoard, in exercise of its powers conferred under section 168(1) of the CGST Act, \\n2017, hereby clarifies the issues hereafter.  \\n3. It is observed that from the present wording of S. No. 4 of Circular No. \\n156/12/2021 dated 21st June 2021, doubt arises whether the relaxation from the \\nrequirement of dynamic QR code on the invoices would be available to such \\nsupplier, who receives payments from the recipient located outside India through \\nRBI approved modes of payment, but not in foreign exchange. It is mentioned \\nthat the intention of clarification as per S. No. 4 in the said circular was not to \\ndeny relaxation in those cases, where the payment is received by the supplier as \\nper any RBI approved mode, other than foreign exchange.  \\n4. Accordingly, to clarify the matter further, the Entry at S. No. 4 of the \\nCircular No. 156/12/2021-GST dated 21st June, 2021 is substituted as below: \\n4. \\n\"In cases, where receiver of services \\nis \\nlocated \\noutside \\nIndia, \\nand \\npayment is being received by the \\nsupplier of services, through RBI \\napproved modes of payment, but as \\nper provisions of the IGST Act \\n2017, the place of supply of such \\nservices is in India, then such supply \\nof services is not considered as \\nexport of services as per the IGST \\nAct 2017; whether in such cases, the \\nDynamic QR Code is required on \\nthe invoice issued, for such supply \\nof services, to such recipient located \\noutside India? \\nNo. Wherever an invoice is issued \\nto a recipient located outside India, \\nfor supply of services, for which \\nthe place of supply is in India, as \\nper the provisions of IGST Act \\n2017, and the payment is received \\nby the supplier, in convertible \\nforeign exchange or in Indian \\nRupees wherever permitted by the \\nRBI, such invoice may be issued \\nwithout having a Dynamic QR \\nCode, as such dynamic QR code \\ncannot be used by the recipient \\nlocated outside India for making \\npayment to the supplier.\" \\nCircular No. 156/12/2021-GST, dated 21.06.2021 stands modified to this \\nextent.',\n",

These two documents used as easy \\nnegotiation instrument to rectify any mistake in amount or any deficiency after \\nissuance of invoice for commercial transaction. The adjustment of short or excess \\nvalue or amount that has occurred in tax invoice is being rectified by credit note \\nand debit note. \\nTherefore, the provisions of credit and debit notes have been rightly \\nincorporated under GST laws for smooth operation of business transaction to \\nrectify any mistake in value or amount with issuance of Tax invoice on supplies \\nof goods and services. Section 34 of the CGST Act, 2017 has specified the \\nprovisions of credit note and debit note. \\n25. Requirement of Credit Note \\nA supplier of goods or services or both is mandatorily required to issue a tax \\ninvoice. However, during the course of trade or commerce, after the invoice has \\nbeen issued there could be situation like: \\n \\n(i) The supplier has erroneously declared a value which is more than the \\nactual value of the goods or services provided. \\n \\n(ii) The supplier has erroneously declared a higher tax rate than what is \\napplicable for the kind of the goods or services or both supplied. \\n (iii) The quantity received by the recipient is less than what has been declared \\nin the tax invoice. \\n (iv) The quality of the goods or services or both supplied is not to the \\nsatisfaction of the recipient thereby necessitating a partial or total \\nreimbursement on the invoice value. \\n \\n(v) Any other similar reasons. \\nIn order to regularize these kinds of situations the supplier is allowed to issue \\nwhat is called as credit note to the recipient. Once the credit note has been issued \\nthe tax liability of the supplier will reduce. Therefore, the issuance of credit note \\nby supplier is required to settle the correct transaction between supplier and \\npurchaser in the GST regime. \\n26.

Electronic Invoicing System  \\nThe GST Council in its 37th meeting has approved introduction of ‘E-\\ninvoicing’ or ‘electronic invoicing’ in a phased manner for reporting of Business \\nto business (B2B) invoices to GST system from 1st January2020 on a trial basis \\nor voluntary basis. In the absence of standard e-invoice, the same has to be \\nfinalized after consultation with trade/industry bodies as well as ICAI after \\nmaking available of draft in public domain. \\n37. Brief about e-invoice \\nE-invoicing is a system of generation of invoices for B2B transaction from a \\ncommon GST portal for the whole country, which is authenticated electronically \\nby GSTN for the use by taxpayers on supply of goods and services or both. It is \\npertinent to mention that taxpayers are using various accounting software such as \\nTally, ERP, Busy, SAP etc. for generating their invoices electronically and to \\nstore information, which may not be adopted by the GST system due to \\ndifference in their formats. Hence, there is need of standardize format in which \\nelectronic data of an invoice will be shared with others to ensure there is inter-\\noperability of the data. The adoption of standards will no way impact the way \\nuser would see the physical (printed) invoice or electronic (ex PDF version) \\ninvoice. All these software would adopt the new e-invoice standard wherein they',\n",
              " 'Chap. 10 \\nTax Invoice, Credit and Debit Notes \\n253 \\n \\nwould re-align their data access and retrieve in the standard format. However, \\nusers of the software would not find any change since they would continue to see \\nthe physical or electronic (PDF/Excel) output of the invoices in the same manner \\nas it existed before incorporation of e-invoice standard in the software. Thus the \\ntaxpayers would continue to use their own accounting system or excel based \\ntools or any such tool for creating the electronic invoice as they are using today.  \\nTo facilitate small taxpayers adopt e-invoice system, GSTN has empanelled \\neight accounting & billing software which provide basic accounting and billing \\nsystem free of cost to small taxpayers. Those small taxpayers, who do not have \\naccounting software today, can use one of the empanelled software products, \\nwhich come in flavors, online (cloud based) as well as offline (installed on the \\ncomputer system of the user). \\n38. Documents are to be reported to GST System \\nE-invoice covers other documents that will be required to be reported to IRP \\nby the creator of the document:  \\n(i) Invoice by Supplier, \\n(ii) Credit Note by Supplier, \\n(iii) Debit Note by Recipient, \\n(iv) Any other document as required by law to be reported by the creator of \\nthe document. \\n39. Workflow involved \\nThe flow of the e-invoice generation, registration and receipt of confirmation \\ncan be logically divided into two major parts:  \\n(a) The first part being the interaction between the business (supplier in case \\nof invoice) and Invoice Registration Portal (IRP). \\n(b) The second part is the interaction between the IRP and the GST/E-Way \\nBill System and the Buyer. \\n40. Flow of activities from Supplier:  \\nStep 1: The supplier’s (seller’s) software should be capable to generate a \\nJSON of the final invoice that is ready to be uploaded to the IRP. The IRP will \\nonly take JSON of the e-invoice. Seller should have a utility that will output \\ninvoice data in JSON format, either from his accounting or billing software or his \\nERP or excel/word document or even a mobile app. Those who do not use any \\naccounting software or IT tool to generate the invoice, will be provided an offline \\ntool to key-in data of invoice and then submit the same. The small and medium \\nsize taxpayers (having annual turnover below `1.50 crores) can avail accounting \\nand billing system being offered by GSTN free of cost. \\nStep 2: Seller has to generate the unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN). \\nThis is an optional step. The seller can also generate this and upload along with \\ninvoice data. Seller has to use Supplier GSTIN, Supplier’s invoice number and \\nfinancial year to generate IRN (hash generation algorithm will be prescribed by \\nGSTN in the e-invoice standard).',\n",
              " '254 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 10 \\n \\nStep 3: Seller has to upload the JSON of the e-invoice (along with the hash, \\nif generated) into the IRP. The JSON may be uploaded directly on the IRP or \\nthrough GSPs or through third party provided Apps. \\nStep 4: The IRP will also generate the hash and validate the hash of the \\nuploaded JSON, if uploaded by the supplier. The IRP will check the hash from \\nthe Central Registry of GST System to ensure that the same invoice from the \\nsame supplier pertaining to same Financial Year is not being uploaded again. On \\nreceipt of confirmation from Central Registry, IRP will add its signature on the \\nInvoice Data as well as a QR code to the JSON. The QR code will contain \\nGSTIN of seller and buyer, Invoice number, invoice date, number of line items, \\nHSN of major commodity contained in the invoice as per value, hash etc. The \\nhash computed by IRP will become the IRN (Invoice Reference Number) of the \\ne-invoice. This shall be unique to each invoice and hence be the unique identity \\nfor each invoice for the entire financial year in the entire GST System for a \\ntaxpayer. GST System will create a central registry where hash sent by all IRPs \\nwill be kept to ensure uniqueness of the same. \\nStep 5: This is the stage involve sharing the uploaded data with GST and e-\\nway bill system, it will be to share e-invoice data along with IRN( same as that \\nhas been returned by the IRP to the seller) to the GST System as well as to E-\\nWay Bill System. The GST System will update the ANX-1 (for outward \\nsupplies) of the seller and ANX-2 (for inward supplies) of the buyer, which in \\nturn will determine tax liability and ITC.  \\nE-way bill system will create Part-A of e-way bill using this data to which \\nonly vehicle number will have to be attached in Part-B of the E-way bill. Buyer \\nhas an option to accept to accept or reject the transaction. The signing of e-\\ninvoice by seller is not mandatory since the invoices with an IRN number will be \\nconsidered as a valid tax invoice for GST purposes. \\n41. Direct Invoice Generation on IRP (Invoice Registration Portal) \\nThere is provision of direct creation/generation of e-invoice from GST portal \\nand no provision of use of any other government portal is not envisaged under \\nproposal of e-invoicing. Invoices will continue to be generated using an \\naccounting/billing software has been adopted by the taxpayers. \\nSmall taxpayers can use one of the eight free accounting/billing software \\nlisted by GSTN. GSTN will provide Offline Tool where data of an invoice, \\ngenerated on paper can be entered which in turn will create JSON file for \\nuploading on the IRP. All accounting and billing software companies are being \\nseparately asked to adopt the e-invoice standard so that their users can generate \\nthe JSON from the software and uploaded the same on the IRP. \\n42. Features of e-invoice system:  \\nThe features of e-invoice system are summarized as under: \\n43. Unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN) \\nThe unique IRN will be based on the computation of hash of GSTIN of \\ngenerator of document (invoice or credit note etc.), Year and Document number',\n",
              " 'Chap. 10 \\nTax Invoice, Credit and Debit Notes \\n255 \\n \\nlike invoice number. This hash will be as published in the e-invoice standard and \\nunique for this combination. This way hash will always the same irrespective of \\nthe registrar who processes it. The hash could also be generated by the taxpayers \\nbased on above algorithm. The providers of accounting and billing software are \\nbeing separately asked to incorporate this feature in their product. One can pre-\\ngenerate and print it on the invoice book, however, the same will not make the \\ninvoice valid unless it is registered on the portal along with invoice details. Only \\nunique invoices from a taxpayer will be accepted and registered by the registrar. \\n44. Digital Signing by e-invoice Registration Portal \\nThe invoice data will be uploaded on the IRP (Invoice Registration Portal), \\nwhich will also generate the hash in order to verify it and then digitally sign it \\nwith the private key of the IRP. In case the taxpayer submits hash also along with \\ninvoice data, the same will be validated by IRN system. The IRP will sign the e-\\ninvoice along with hash and the e-invoice signed by the IRP will be a valid e-\\ninvoice and used by GST/E-Way Bill system. \\n45. QR Code \\nThe IRP will also generate a QR code containing the unique IRN (hash) \\nalong with some important parameters of invoice and digital signature so that it \\ncan be verified on the central portal as well as by an offline App. This will be \\nhelpful for tax officers checking the invoice on the roadside where Internet may \\nnot be available all the time. The web user will get a printable form with all \\ndetails including QR code. The QR code will consist of the following e-invoice \\nparameters: \\n(a) GSTIN of supplier, \\n(b) GSTIN of Recipient, \\n(c) Invoice number as given by Supplier, \\n(d) Date of generation of invoice, \\n(e) Invoice value (taxable value and gross tax), \\n(f) Number of line items, \\n(g) HSN Code of main item (the line item having highest taxable value), \\n(h) Unique Invoice Reference Number (hash). \\n46. The offline app \\nThe offline app will be provided on the IRP for anyone to download to \\nauthenticate the QR code of the invoice offline and its basic details. However, to \\nsee the whole invoice, one will have to connect to the portal and verify and see \\nthe details online. The facility to download entire invoice will be provided to tax \\nofficers, the way it is currently available under E-way Bill system. \\n47. Multiple Registrars for IRN system \\nMultiple registrars (IPRs) will be put in place to ensure 24x7 operations \\nwithout any break. To start with, NIC will be the first Registrar. Based on \\nexperience of the trial more registrars will be added.',\n",

Standardization of Invoice \\nA technical group constituted by GST Council Secretariat has drafted \\nstandards for e-invoice after having industry consultation. The e-invoice scheme \\nand template, as approved by the GST Council, are available at \\nhttps://www.gstn.org/e-invoice/. \\n49. Creation of E-invoice \\nMode for getting invoice registered: Multiple modes will be made available \\nso that taxpayer can use the best mode based on their need. The modes are \\nenvisaged under proposed system for e-invoicing, through the IRP (Invoice \\nRegistration Portal) is listed as under: \\n(a) Web based, \\n(b) API based, \\n(c) SMS based, \\n(d) mobile app based, \\n(e) offline tool based and \\n(f) GSP based. \\n50. API mode \\nUsing API mode, the big tax payers and accounting software providers can \\ninterface their system and pull the IRN after passing the relevant invoice \\ninformation in JSON format. API request will handle one invoice request at time \\nto generate the IRN. This mode will also be used for bulk requirement (user can \\npass the request one after the other and get the IRN response within fraction of \\nsecond) as well. The e-way Bill system provides the same methodology. \\n51. Printing of Invoice \\nThe taxpayers can continue to print their paper invoice as they are doing \\ntoday including logo and other information. E-invoice scheme only mandates \\nwhat will be reported in electronic format to IRP. \\n52. E-Invoice and Tax department \\nThe e-invoice system being implemented by Tax Departments across the \\nglobe consists of two important parts namely, \\n(a) Generation of invoice in a standard format so that invoice generated on \\none system can be read by another system. \\n(b) Reporting of e-invoice to a central system. \\nThe basic aim behind adoption of e-invoice system by tax departments is \\nability to pre-populate the return and to reduce the reconciliation problems. Huge \\nincrease in technology sophistication, increased penetration of Internet along \\nwith availability of computer system at reasonable cost has made this journey \\npossible and hence more than 60 countries are in the process of adopting the e-\\ninvoice.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 10 \\nTax Invoice, Credit and Debit Notes \\n257 \\n \\nGST Council has given the responsibility to design the standard of e-invoice \\nand update the same time to time to GSTN which is the custodian of Returns and \\ninvoices contained in the same. Adoption of e-invoice by GST System is not only \\npart of Tax reform but also a Business reform as it make the e-invoices \\ncompletely inter-operable eliminating transcription and other errors. \\n53. Benefits on e-invoicing System \\nBetter taxpayer services: \\n\\uf0d8 One time reporting on B2B invoice data in the form it is generated to \\nreduce reporting in multiple formats (one for GSTR-1 and the other E-\\nway Bill). \\n\\uf0d8 To generate Sales and purchases register (ANX-1 and ANX-2) from this \\ndata to keep the Return (RET-1 etc.) ready for filing under New Return, \\nE-way Bill can also be generated using e-invoice data. \\n\\uf0d8 It will become part of the business process of the taxpayer. \\n\\uf0d8 Substantial reduction in input credit verification issues as same data will \\nget reported to tax department as well to buyer in his inward supply \\n(purchase) register. \\n\\uf0d8 On receipt of information through GST System as buyer can do \\nreconciliation with his Purchase Order and accept/reject in time under \\nNew Return. \\n54. Reduction of tax evasion \\n\\uf0d8 Complete trail of B2B invoices \\n\\uf0d8 System level matching of input credit and output tax \\n55. Efficiency in tax administration:  \\n\\uf0d8 Elimination of fake invoices \\nGeneration of e-invoice will be the responsibility of the taxpayer who will be \\nrequired to report the same to Invoice Registration Portal ( IRP) of GST, which \\nin turn will generate a unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN) and digitally sign \\nthe e-invoice and also generate a QR Code. The QR Code will contain vital \\nparameters of the e-invoice and return the same to the taxpayer who generated \\nthe document in first place. The IRP will also send the signed e-invoice to the \\nrecipient of the document on the e-mail provided in the e-invoice. Therefore, \\nonce invoice which will be uploaded by supplier on GST system for \\nauthentication will be further shared with corresponding buyer on his mail id \\nmentioned on e-invoice, hence buyer can do reconciliation with his purchase \\norder and accept/reject on real time under New Return. System level matching \\nwill be done for input credit and output tax. E-way bill will also be created \\nthrough e-invoicing data only vehicle number needs to be uploaded. E-invoicing \\nis a complete system of not only sales/purchase accounting but also generation of \\nmonthly returns under GST including E-way Bill for movement of goods across \\nthe country.',\n",

E-Invoicing under GST  \\nE-invoicing is a system of generation of invoices for B2B transaction from a \\ncommon GST portal for the whole country, which is authenticated electronically \\nby GSTN for the use by taxpayers on supply of goods and services or both. \\nRegistered persons will continue to create their GST invoices on their own \\nAccounting/Billing/ERP Systems. These invoices will now be reported to \\n‘Invoice Registration Portal (IRP)’. On reporting, IRP returns the e-invoice with \\na unique ‘Invoice Reference Number (IRN)’ after digitally signing the e-invoice \\nand adding a QR Code. Then, the invoice can be issued to the receiver (along \\nwith QR Code).

Accordingly, steps have been initiated to introduce 'e-invoicing' for \\nreporting of Business to Business (B2B) invoices, beginning from 1st January, \\n2020 on voluntary basis.  \\nGST Council, in its 39th meeting, held on 14th March, 2020, further \\nrecommended certain classes of registered persons to be exempt from issuing e-\\ninvoices and the date for implementation of e-invoicing to be extended to \\n01.10.2020 for certain category of taxpayers.  \\nAs per Notification (Central Tax) No. 61/2020 dated 30th July 2020, the \\nreporting has been mandated for taxpayers having annual aggregate turnover of \\n`500 Crore and above in a financial year. \\nAs per latest notification, e-invoicing will be mandatory w.e.f. 1st October, \\n2020, for notified classes of registered persons (those having aggregate annual \\nturnover at PAN level more than `500 Crores). \\n64. Exempted from issuing e-invoices \\nThe following classes of registered persons have been exempted from issuing \\ne-invoices:  \\n(a) Special Economic Zone Units. \\n(b) Insurer or a banking company or a financial institution, including a non-\\nbanking financial company. \\n(c) Goods transport agency supplying services in relation to transportation of \\ngoods by road in a goods carriage. \\n(d) Suppliers of passenger transportation service. \\n(e) Suppliers of services by way of admission to exhibition of \\ncinematograph films in multiplex screens.\",\n",

              " 'Chap. 10 \\nTax Invoice, Credit and Debit Notes \\n265 \\n \\n76. e-invoice – Schema (Standard format) \\nPresently, businesses are using various accounting/billing software, each \\ngenerating and storing invoices in their own electronic formats. These different \\nformats are neither understood by GST System nor among the systems of \\nsuppliers and receivers. For example, an invoice generated by SAP system \\ncannot be read by a machine which is using ‘Tally’ system, unless a connector is \\nused. With more than 300 accounting/billing software products, there is no way \\nto have connectors for all. \\nIn this scenario, ‘e-invoicing’ aims at machine-readability and uniform \\ninterpretation. To ensure this complete ‘inter-operability’ of e-invoices across the \\nentire GST eco-system, an invoice standard is a must. By this, e-invoices \\ngenerated by one software can be read by any other software, thereby eliminating \\nthe need of fresh/manual data entry.  \\nSince, there was no such standard for e-invoice in the country, as a first step, \\na standard/format for e-invoice has been finalized after detailed consultations \\nwith Trade/Industry Bodies (CII, PHD, FICCI, ASSOCHAM etc.), as well as \\nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Though it is based on \\ninternational standard (UBL/PEPPOL), it has been customized to cater to Indian \\nbusiness practices and requirements.  \\nThe Schema/Format was notified as Form GST INV-1. \\n77. e-invoice – Process \\n‘E-invoicing’ is not generation of invoice by a Government portal. Taxpayers \\nwill continue to create their GST invoices on their own Accounting/Billing/ERP \\nSystems. These invoices will now be reported to ‘Invoice Registration Portal \\n(IRP)’. On reporting, IRP will generate a unique ‘Invoice Reference Number \\n(IRN)’, digitally sign it and return the e-invoice. A GST invoice will be valid \\nonly with a valid IRN.  \\nIRP will also generate a QR code containing the unique IRN along with \\ncertain other key particulars. The QR code (which can be printed on invoice) \\nenables offline verification of the fact whether the e-invoice has been reported on \\nthe IRP or not (using Mobile App etc.). \\nE-invoice schema only mandates what particulars shall be reported in \\nelectronic format to IRP so as to receive signed e-invoice from IRP. On \\nsuccessful reporting of invoice in JSON format to IRP, the supplier receives a \\nsigned JSON from the IRP which also includes data of a QR code. This payload \\ncan be converted to readable format and populated into a PDF file also. If the \\ntaxpayer desires, he can print it as paper invoice, as he is doing today, by also \\nplacing entity logo and other information, as needed.

Workflow-Process \\nThe flow of the e-invoice generation, registration and receipt of confirmation \\ncan be logically divided into two major parts:',\n",
              " '266 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 10 \\n \\n(a) The first part being the interaction between the business (supplier in \\ncase of invoice) and Invoice Registration Portal (IRP). \\n(b) The second part is the interaction between the IRP and the GST/E-\\nWay Bill System and the Buyer. \\n79. Flow from Supplier to IRP \\nStep 1: is the generation of the invoice by the seller in his own accounting or \\nbilling system (it can be any software utility that generates invoice including \\nthose using excel or MS-Word). The invoice must conform to the e-invoice \\nschema (standard format notified) and have the mandatory parameters. The \\noptional parameters can be according to the business need of the supplier. The \\nsupplier’s (seller’s) software should be capable to generate a JSON of the final \\ninvoice that is ready to be uploaded to the IRP. The IRP will only take JSON of \\nthe e-invoice. In case the taxpayer’s billing software/ERP does not have \\ncapability to generate JSON of e-invoice as per notified Format, she should either \\nask the software provider to provide the same or take this service from others \\nwho are providing this as service. \\nSteps 2 and 3: To upload and push the e-invoice JSON to the IRP by the \\nseller. The JSON may be uploaded directly on the IRP or also through GSPs or \\nthrough third party, if software is available for the same. \\nStep 4: The IRP will generate Invoice Reference Number (IRN), based on \\nSupplier’s GSTIN, Document Type, Document Number and Financial Year and \\ncheck the same from the Central Registry of GST System to ensure that the same \\ndocument (invoice etc.) from the same supplier pertaining to same Financial Year \\nis not being uploaded again. In computer science language, IRN is called hash. \\nOn receipt of confirmation from Central Registry, IRP will add its signature \\non the Invoice Data as well as a QR code to the JSON. The QR code will contain \\nGSTINs of seller and buyer, Invoice number, invoice date, number of line items, \\nHSN of major commodity contained in the invoice as per value, hash etc. The \\nhash computed by IRP will become the IRN (Invoice Reference Number) of the \\ne-invoice. This shall be unique to each invoice and hence be the unique identity \\nfor each invoice for the entire financial year in the entire GST System for a \\ntaxpayer. GST System will create a central registry where hashes sent by all IRPs \\nwill be kept to ensure uniqueness of the same. Currently, GST System uses \\nsimilar logic to ensure uniqueness of each B2B invoice which is uploaded as part \\nof GSTR1. \\nIn case the same document has been uploaded earlier, the IRP will reject it \\nwith an error code, back to the supplier. \\nStep 5 will involve returning the digitally signed JSON with IRN back to the \\nseller along with a QR code.  \\nStep 6 will involve sharing the uploaded data of document (invoice etc.) with \\nGST and e-way bill system.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 10 \\nTax Invoice, Credit and Debit Notes \\n267 \\n \\n80. Flow from IRP to GST System/E-Way Bill System & Buyer: \\nThe following diagram shows how e-Invoice data would be consumed by \\nGST System for generation of e-way bill or populating relevant parts GST \\nReturns, stated in Step-6 above. \\nStep 6(a) will be to send the signed and authenticated e-invoice data along \\nwith IRN (same as that has been returned by the IRP to the seller) to the GST \\nSystem as well as to E-Way Bill System.  \\nStep 6(b) The GST System will update GSTR-1.  \\nStep 6(c) The e-invoice schema includes parameters e.g. ‘Transporter ID’ \\nand ‘Vehicle Number’, etc. that are required for creating and generating e-way \\nbills. These can be entered if available with seller, at the time of generation of e-\\ninvoice so that e-way bill can be created using this data without any further \\nrequirement of data entry by the user. The e-invoice reporting software already \\nallows reporting of e-invoice and generation of e-way bill with same data. \\n81. e-invoice – Salient Features \\n82. Unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN) \\nThe unique IRN will be based on the computation of hash of GSTIN of \\ngenerator of document (invoice or credit note or debit note), Financial Year, \\nDocument Type and Document number like invoice number. This hash will be as \\npublished in the e-invoice standard and unique for this combination. This way \\nhash will always be the same irrespective of the registrar who processes it.  \\nTo ensure de-duplication, the registrar will be required to send the hash to \\nCentral Registry of GST System to confirm whether the same has been reported \\nalready. In case, it has been reported by another registrar (as and when more \\nregistrars/IRPs are added) and the Central Registry already has the same IRN, \\nthen the registrar will reject the registration and inform the sender by sending \\nappropriate error code. Only unique invoices from a taxpayer will be accepted \\nand registered by the registrar. \\n83. Digital Signing of e-invoice by Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) \\nAfter the invoice data will be uploaded on the IRP (Invoice Registration \\nPortal), the IRP will generate the hash (as the IRN) and then digitally sign it with \\nthe private key of the IRP. The IRP will sign the complete e-invoice JSON \\npayload (that includes the IRN/hash). Thereafter, this e-invoice signed by the IRP \\nwill be a valid e-invoice for the seller and can be used by the seller for his \\nbusiness transactions. \\n84. QR Code with key particulars: QR Code \\nThe IRP will also generate a QR code containing the unique IRN (hash) \\nalong with some important parameters of invoice and digital signature so that it \\ncan be verified on the central portal as well as by a Mobile App. This will be \\nhelpful for tax officers to verify the authenticity of invoice during road checks \\nwhen Internet connectivity may not be available all the time.',\n",

Multiple Registrars for IRN system \\nMultiple registrars (IPRs) will be put in place to ensure 24x7 operations \\nwithout any break. To start with, NIC will be the first Registrar. Based on \\nexperience of the trial more registrars will be added. \\n86. Standardization of e-invoice \\nA technical group constituted by the GST Council Secretariat has drafted \\nstandards for e-invoice after having industry consultation. The e-invoice \\nschema/template is since notified as Form GST-INV-1. \\n87. Multiple Modes for reporting e-invoice \\nMultiple modes will be made available so that taxpayer can use the best \\nmode based on his/her need. The modes are envisaged under proposed system for \\ne-invoicing, through the IRP (Invoice Registration Portal) is listed as under: \\n(a) Web based, \\n(b) API based, \\n(c) SMS based and \\n(d) GSP based. \\nUsing API mode, the applicable taxpayers and their ERP/internal IT \\nservices/accounting software providers can interface their systems and get the \\nsigned e-invoice from IRP - after passing the relevant invoice information in \\nJSON format. APIs will also handle multiple requests for invoices registration \\nand to generate the IRN. This mode can also be used for multiple invoices as \\nwell. The e-way bill system provides the same methodology. \\n88. Printing of e-Invoice \\nThe supplier receives a signed JSON from the IRP.

The facility \\nof furnishing details of invoices in IFF has been provided so as to allow details of \\nsuch supplies to be duly reflected in the FORM GSTR-2A and FORM GSTR-2B \\nof the concerned recipient.  \\nFor example, a registered person who has availed the Scheme wants to \\ndeclare two invoices out of the total ten invoices issued in the first month of \\nquarter since the recipient of supplies covered by those two invoices desires to \\navail ITC in that month itself.

Scrutiny Schedule: \\n4.1 Once the details of GSTINs selected for scrutiny for a financial year are \\nmade available on the scrutiny dashboard of the concerned proper officer of Cen-\\ntral Tax on ACES-GST application, the proper officer, with the approval of the \\ndivisional Assistant/Deputy Commissioner, shall finalize a scrutiny schedule in \\nthe format specified in Annexure A of Instruction 02/2022-GST dated 22nd \\nMarch 2022.Such scrutiny schedule will specify month-wise schedule for scruti-\\nny in respect of all the GSTINs selected for scrutiny. While preparing the scruti-\\nny schedule, the scrutiny of the GSTINs, which appear to be riskier based on the \\nlikely higher revenue implication indicated on the dashboard, may be prioritized. \\nThe Principal Commissioner/Commissioner of the concerned Commissionerate \\nwill monitor and ensure that the schedule identified in Scrutiny Schedule is ad-\\nhered to by the officers under his jurisdiction. \\n4.2 The proper officer shall conduct scrutiny of returns pertaining to mini-\\nmum of 4 GSTINs per month. Scrutiny of returns of one GSTIN shall mean scru-\\ntiny of all returns pertaining to a financial year for which the said GSTIN has \\nbeen selected for scrutiny. \\n5. Process of scrutiny by the Proper Officer: \\n5.1 The Proper Officer shall scrutinize the returns and related particulars fur-\\nnished by the registered persons to verify the correctness of the returns. Infor-\\nmation available with the proper officer on the system in the form of various re-\\nturns and statements furnished by the registered person and the data/details made \\navailable through various sources like DGARM, ADVAIT, GSTN, E-Way Bill \\nPortal etc. may be relied upon for this purpose. \\n5.2 As mentioned in Para 3.2 above, for the convenience of proper officers, \\ndetails of the risk parameters involving risk/discrepancies in respect of the \\nGSTIN, along with the amount of tax/discrepancy involved in respect of the con-\\ncerned risk parameters (i.e. likely revenue implication), will be made available in \\nthe scrutiny dashboard of the proper officer. Besides, DGARM will also make \\navailable to the field formations the details of all the risk parameters taken into \\nconsideration by them for the selection of GSTINs for scrutiny of returns for the \\nparticular financial year. In addition to these parameters, proper officer may also \\nconsider any other relevant parameter, as he may deem fit, for the purpose of \\nscrutiny. \\n5.3 It may be noted that at this stage, the proper officer is expected to rely \\nupon the information available with him on records.

While issuing such notice, the proper officer \\nmay, as far as possible, quantify the amount of tax, interest and any other amount \\npayable in relation to such discrepancies. It may also be ensured that the discrep-\\nancies so communicated should, as far as possible, be specific in nature and not \\nvague or general. In this regard, the user manual issued by DG Systems may be \\nreferred to regarding the detailed procedure for issuance of FORM GST ASMT-\\n10on scrutiny functionality on ACES-GST application. The proper officer shall \\nmention the parameter-wise details of the discrepancies noticed by him in FORM \\nGST ASMT-10 and shall also upload the worksheets and supporting docu-\\nment(s)/annexures, if any. \\n5.5 For each GSTIN identified for scrutiny, the proper officer is required to \\nscrutinize all the returns pertaining to the corresponding Financial Year under \\nconsideration and a single compiled notice in FORM GST ASMT-10 may be \\nissued to the registered person for that financial year. \\n5.6 On receipt of such notice in FORM GST ASMT-10 on common portal, \\nthe registered person may accept the discrepancy mentioned in the said notice, \\nand pay the tax, interest and any other amount arising from such discrepancy and \\ninform the same or may furnish an explanation for the discrepancy in FORM \\nGST ASMT-11, through the common portal, to the proper officer within the time \\nperiod prescribed under rule 99 of CGST Rules. \\n5.7 The reply furnished by the registered person in FORM GST ASMT-11 on \\nthe common portal shall be made available to the concerned proper officer in the \\nscrutiny dashboard on ACES-GST application.

Introduction \\nThe concept of Reverse Charge Mechanism was introduced in erstwhile \\nService Tax laws. Generally, tax is payable by the person who provides services \\nbut under Reverse Charge Mechanism the liability to pay tax has shifted to \\nrecipient of services. The concept of Reverse Charge Mechanism is incorporated \\nunder GST, but in GST regime Government is notified not only supply of certain \\nservices but also supply of certain goods. The objective of Reverse Charge \\nMechanism is to widen the scope of levy of tax on unorganized sectors and give \\nexemption to specific class of supplier of goods/services and import of services. \\nTherefore, under Reverse Charge Mechanism the liability to pay tax is fixed \\non the recipient of supply of goods or services instead of the supplier or provider \\nin respect of certain categories of goods or services or both under Section 9(3) or \\nSection 9(4) of the CGST Act, 2017 and under sub-section (3) or sub-section (4) \\nof Section 5 of the IGST Act, 2017.',\n",

First situation is \\ndependent on the nature of supply and/or nature of supplier. This is covered by \\nSection 9(3) of the CGST/SGST/UTGST Act and Section 5(3) of the IGST Act. \\nSecond situation is covered by Section 9(4) of the CGST/SGST/UTGST Act and \\nSection 5(4) of the IGST Act where a taxable supply by any unregistered person \\nto a registered person is covered. Accordingly, whenever a registered person \\nprocures supplies from an unregistered supplier, he needs to pay GST on reverse \\ncharge basis. However, supplies where the aggregate value of such supplies of \\ngoods or services or both received by a registered person from any or all the \\nunregistered suppliers is less than five thousand rupees in a day are exempted \\nvide Notification No. 8/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated 28-6-2017. \\n5. Compulsory GST registration under RCM (Threshold limit of \\nregistration is not applicable under RCM) \\nAs per Section 24 of the CGST Act, 2017, a person who is required to pay \\ntax under reverse charge has to compulsorily register under GST irrespective of \\nthe threshold limit of registration and threshold limit of ₹20 lakhs/₹40 lakhs (₹10 \\nlakhs for special category States except J&K) but special category States \\nthreshold exemption is increased to ₹20 lakhs (as per CGST Amendment Act, \\n2018) is not applicable to the Reverse Charge Mechanism. \\n6. Invoicing Rules under RCM  \\nUnder reverse charge, the buyer or recipient of goods or services or both has \\nto issue invoice or payment voucher on received of goods or services or both \\nfrom the supplier as may be the case.',\n",

However, Tax on cement purchased \\nfrom unregistered person shall be paid @28% under RCM, and on capital goods \\nunder RCM at applicable rates in terms of Section 9(4) the CGST Act, 2017, in \\nterms of C.B.I & C., Notification No. 7/2019-C.T. (Rate), dated 29th March, \\n2019. \\n8. Renting of motor vehicles under RCM \\nThe GST Council in its 37’th meeting has taken decision to place the supply \\nof renting of motor vehicles under RCM and recommended that the said supply \\nwhen provided by suppliers paying GST @5% to corporate entities may be \\nplaced under RCM. RCM was not recommended for suppliers paying GST @ \\n12% with full ITC, so that they may have may have the option to continue to \\navail ITC. RCM otherwise would have blocked the ITC chain for them. \\nAccordingly, the Notification No. 29/2019-Central Tax (Rate) dated 31.12.2019 \\nhas been issued with effect from 1.10.2019. \\nPost issuance of the notification, reference have been received stating that \\nwhen a service is covered by RCM, GST would be paid by the service recipient \\nand not by the supplier. Therefore, the wording of the notification that any person \\nother than a body corporate, paying central tax at the rate of 2.5% is not free from \\ndoubt and needs amendment/clarification from the perspective of drafting.  \\nC.B.I&C, vide its Circular No 130/2019-GST dated 31.12.2019, has clarified \\nthat When any service is placed under RCM, the supplier shall not charge any tax \\nfrom the service recipient as this is the settled procedure in law under RCM. \\nThere are only two rates applicable on the service of renting of vehicles, 5% with \\nlimited ITC and 12% with full ITC. The only interpretation of the notification \\nentry in question which is not absurd would be that –  \\n(i)  where the supplier of the service charges GST @ 12% from the service \\nrecipient, the service recipient shall not be liable to pay GST under \\nRCM; and,  \\n(ii)  where the supplier of the service doesn’t charge GST @ 12% from the \\nservice recipient, the service recipient shall be liable to pay GST under \\nRCM.  \\nThough a supplier providing the service to a body corporate under RCM may \\nstill be paying GST @ 5% on the services supplied to other non-body corporate \\nclients, to bring in greater clarity, serial No. 15 of the Notification No. 13/2017-\\nCT (R) dated 28.6.17 has been amended vide notification No. 29/2019-CT (R) \\ndated 31.12.19 to state that RCM shall be applicable on the service by way of \\nrenting of any motor vehicle designed to carry passengers where the cost of fuel \\nis included in the consideration charged from the service recipient only if the \\nsupplier fulfils all the following conditions:—',\n",
              " 'Chap. 14 \\nReverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) under GST Law \\n371 \\n \\n(a)  is other than a body-corporate;  \\n(b) does not issue an invoice charging GST @12% from the service recipient; \\nand  \\n(c)  supplies the service to a body corporate. \\n9. Input Tax Credit under RCM \\nA supplier cannot take Input Tax Credit of GST paid on goods or services \\nused to make supplies on which the recipient is liable to pay tax under reverse \\ncharge. \\nThe recipient can avail Input Tax Credit of GST amount that is paid under \\nreverse charge on receipt of goods or services by him. \\nGST paid on goods or services under reverse charge mechanism is available \\nas ITC to the registered person provided that such goods or services are used or \\nwill be used for business or furtherance of business. \\nThe ITC is availed by recipient cannot be used towards payment of output \\ntax on goods or services, the payment of tax under reverse charge only on cash. \\n10. Liability arises to pay GST under RCM  \\nThe time of supply is the point when the supply is liable to GST. One of the \\nfactors relevant for determining time of supply is the person who is liable to pay \\ntax. In reverse charge, the recipient is liable to pay GST. Thus, time of supply for \\nsupplies under reverse charge is different from the supplies which are under \\nforward charge. \\n11. Time of supply for Goods under reverse charge:  \\nAs per Section 12(3) of the CGST Act, 2017 in case of supplies of goods in \\nrespect of which tax is paid or liable to be paid on reverse charge basis, the time \\nof supply shall be the earliest of the following dates, namely:— \\n(a) date of receipt of goods; or \\n(b) date of payment as entered in the books of account of the recipient or the \\ndate on which the payment is debited in his bank account, whichever is \\nearlier; or \\n(c) the date immediately following 30 days from the date of issue of invoice \\nor any other document, or similar other document thereof by the supplier: \\nProvided that where it is not possible to determine the time of supply under \\nclause (a) or clause (b) or clause (c), the time of supply shall be the date of entry \\nin the books of account of the recipient of supply. \\n12. Time of supply for Services under Reverse Charge:  \\nAs per Section 13(3) of the CGST Act, 2017 in case of supplies for Services \\nin respect of which tax is paid or liable to be paid on reverse charge basis, the \\ntime of supply shall be the earliest of the following dates, namely:— \\n(a) the date of payment as entered in the books of account of the recipient or \\nthe date on which the payment is debited in his bank account, whichever \\nis earlier; or',\n",
              " '372 \\nGST Smart Guide  \\nChap. 14 \\n \\n(b) the date immediately following 60 days from the date of issue of invoice \\nor any other documents, similar other document thereof by the supplier: \\nProvided, where it is not possible to determine time of supply by using above \\nmethods under clause (a) and clause (b), the time of supply shall be the date of \\nentry in the books of account of the recipient of supply. \\n13. Compliances in respect of supplies under Reverse Charge Mechanism  \\n(1) As per Section 31 of the CGST Act, 2017 read with Rule 46 of the CGST \\nRules, 2017, every tax invoice has to mention whether the tax in respect \\nof supply in the invoice is payable on reverse charge. Similarly, this also \\nneeds to be mentioned in receipt voucher as well as refund voucher, if \\ntax is payable on reverse charge. \\n(2) Maintenance of accounts by registered persons: Every registered \\nperson is required to keep and maintain records of all supplies attracting \\npayment of tax on reverse charge. \\n(3) Any amount payable under reverse charge shall be paid by debiting the \\nelectronic cash ledger. In other words, reverse charge liability cannot be \\ndischarged by using input tax credit. However, after discharging reverse \\ncharge liability, credit of the same can be taken by the recipient, if he is \\notherwise eligible. \\n(4) Invoice level information in respect of all supplies attracting reverse \\ncharge, rate wise, are to be furnished separately in column 4B of GSTR-\\n1. \\n(5) Advance paid for reverse charge supplies is also leviable to GST. The \\nperson making advance payment has to pay tax on reverse charge basis. \\nAs per the recommendations of 45th GST Council meeting held on \\nSeptember 17, 2021.

On \\nverification, several such exporters were found to be non-existent in a number of \\ncases. In all these cases it has been found that the Input Tax Credit (ITC) was \\ntaken by the exporters on the basis of fake invoices and IGST on exports was \\npaid using such ITC.  \\n2. To mitigate the risk, the Board has taken measures to apply stringent risk \\nparameters-based checks driven by rigorous data analytics and Artificial \\nIntelligence tools based on which certain exporters are taken up for further \\nverification. Overall, in a broader time frame the percentage of such exporters \\nselected for verification is a small fraction of the total number of exporters \\nclaiming refunds. The refund scrolls in such cases are kept in abeyance till the \\nverification report in respect of such cases is received from the field formations. \\nFurther, the export consignments/shipments of concerned exporters are subjected \\nto 100 % examination at the customs port.',\n",
              " '432 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 16 \\n \\n3. While the verifications are caused to mitigate risk, it is necessary that \\ngenuine exporters do not face any hardship. In this context it is advised that \\nexporters whose scrolls have been kept in abeyance for verification would be \\ninformed at the earliest possible either by the jurisdictional CGST or by Customs. \\nTo expedite the verification, the exporters on being informed in this regard or on \\ntheir own volition should fill in information in the format attached as Annexure \\n‘A’ to this Circular and submit the same to their jurisdictional CGST authorities \\nfor verification by them. If required, the jurisdictional authority may seek further \\nadditional information for verification. However, the jurisdictional authorities \\nmust adhere to timelines prescribed for verification.  \\n3.1 Verification shall be completed by jurisdiction CGST office within 14 \\nworking days of furnishing of information in proforma by the exporter. If the \\nverification is not completed within this period, the jurisdiction officer will bring \\nit the notice of a nodal cell to be constituted in the jurisdictional Pr. Chief \\nCommissioner/Chief Commissioner Office. \\n3.2 After a period of 14 working days from the date of submission of details \\nin the prescribed format, the exporter may also escalate the matter to the \\nJurisdictional Pr. Chief Commissioner/Chief Commissioner of Central Tax by \\nsending an email to the Chief Commissioner concerned (email IDs of \\njurisdictional Chief Commissioners are in Annexure B).  \\n3.3 The Jurisdictional Pr. Chief Commissioner/Chief Commissioner of \\nCentral Tax should take appropriate action to get the verification completed \\nwithin next 7 working days. \\n4. In case, any refund remains pending for more than one month, the exporter \\nmay register his grievance at www.cbic.gov.in/issue by giving all relevant details \\nlike GSTIN, IEC, Shipping Bill No., Port of Export & CGST formation where \\nthe details in prescribed format had been submitted etc..

CBIC clarified certain issues related to refund under GST:  \\nThe CBIC issued Circular No. 135/05/2020- GST dated March 31, 2020 \\nafter receiving various representations seeking clarification on some of the issues \\nrelating to GST refunds: \\n1. Bunching of refund claims across Financial Years: - \\n \\nIssue: The restriction on clubbing of tax periods across different financial \\nyears was put in vide para 11.2 of the Circular No. 37/11/2018-GST dated \\nMarch 15, 2018. The said circular was rescinded being subsumed in the \\nMaster Circular on Refunds No. 125/44/2019-GST dated November 18, 2019 \\n(“Master Refund Circular”) and the said restriction on the clubbing of tax \\nperiods across financial years for claiming refund thus has been continued \\nvide Paragraph 8 of the Master Refund Circular. The restriction imposed vide \\npara 8 of the Master Refund Circular prohibits the refund of Input Tax Credit \\n(“ITC”) accrued. \\n \\nClarification: Restriction on clubbing of tax periods across Financial Years \\nhas been removed. Accordingly, Master Refund Circular is modified to that \\nextent i.e. the restriction on bunching of refund claims across financial years \\nshall not apply. \\n2. Refund of accumulated ITC on account of reduction in GST Rate:— \\n \\nIssue: Applicants are seeking refund of unutilized ITC on account of \\ninverted duty structure where the inversion is due to change in the GST rate \\non the same goods. This can be explained through an illustration. An \\napplicant trading in goods has purchased, say goods “X” attracting 18% \\nGST. However, subsequently, the rate of GST on “X” has been reduced to, \\nsay 12%. It is being claimed that accumulation of ITC in such a case is also \\ncovered as accumulation on account of inverted duty structure and such',\n",
              " 'Chap. 16 \\nRefund under GST \\n435 \\n \\napplicants have sought refund of accumulated ITC under Section 54(3)(ii) of \\nthe Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (“CGST Act”). \\n \\nClarification: The refund of accumulated ITC under Section 54(3)(ii) of the \\nCGST Act is available where the credit has accumulated on account of rate \\nof tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on output supplies. It is \\nnoteworthy that, the input and output being the same in such cases, though \\nattracting different tax rates at different points in time, do not get covered \\nunder the provisions of Section 54(3)(ii) of the CGST Act. Therefore, refund \\nof accumulated ITC under Section 54(3)(ii) of the CGST Act would not be \\napplicable in cases where the input and the output supplies are the same. \\n3. Change in manner of refund of tax paid on supplies other than zero \\nrated supplies:- \\n \\nIssue: Master Refund Circular, in para 3, categorizes the refund applications \\nto be filed in FORM GST RFD-01 as under: \\n“(a) Refund of unutilized input tax credit (ITC) on account of exports \\nwithout payment of tax \\n1. Refund of tax paid on export of services with payment of tax; \\n2. Refund of unutilized ITC on account of supplies made to SEZ \\nUnit/SEZ Developer without payment of tax; \\n3. Refund of tax paid on supplies made to SEZ Unit/SEZ Developer \\nwith payment of tax; \\n4. Refund of unutilized ITC on account of accumulation due to \\ninverted tax structure; \\n5. Refund to supplier of tax paid on deemed export supplies; \\n6. Refund to recipient of tax paid on deemed export supplies; \\n7. Refund of excess balance in the electronic cash ledger; \\n8. Refund of excess payment of tax; \\n9. Refund of tax paid on intra-State supply which is subsequently \\nheld to be inter State supply and vice versa; \\n10. Refund on account of assessment/provisional assessment/appeal/ \\nany other order; \\n11. Refund on account of “any other” ground or reason.” \\nFor the refund of tax paid falling in categories specified at S. No. (i) to (l) \\nabove i.e. refund claims on supplies other than zero rated supplies, no \\nseparate debit of ITC from electronic credit ledger is required to be made by \\nthe applicant at the time of filing refund claim, being claim of tax already \\npaid. However, the total tax would have been normally paid by the applicant \\nby debiting tax amount from both electronic credit ledger and electronic cash \\nledger. At present, in these cases, the amount of admissible refund, is paid in \\ncash even when such payment of tax or any part thereof, has been made \\nthrough ITC.',\n",
              " '436 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 16 \\n \\nAs this could lead to allowing unintended encashment of credit balances, \\nvide notification No. 16/2020-Central Tax dated March 23, 2020, sub-rule \\n(4A) has been inserted in Rule 86 of the Central Goods and Services Tax \\nRules, 2017 (“CGST Rules”) which reads as under: \\n“(4A) Where a registered person has claimed refund of any amount paid \\nas tax wrongly paid or paid in excess for which debit has been made \\nfrom the electronic credit ledger, the said amount, if found admissible, \\nshall be re-credited to the electronic credit ledger by the proper officer by \\nan order made in FORM GST PMT-03.” \\nFurther, vide the same notification; sub-rule (1A) has also been inserted in \\nRule 92 of the CGST Rules. The same is reproduced hereunder: \\n“(1A) Where, upon examination of the application of refund of any \\namount paid as tax other than the refund of tax paid on zero-rated \\nsupplies or deemed export, the proper officer is satisfied that a refund \\nunder sub-section (5) of section 54 of the Act is due and payable to the \\napplicant, he shall make an order in FORM RFD-06 sanctioning the \\namount of refund to be paid, in cash, proportionate to the amount debited \\nin cash against the total amount paid for discharging tax liability for the \\nrelevant period, mentioning therein the amount adjusted against any \\noutstanding demand under the Act or under any existing law and the \\nbalance amount refundable and for the remaining amount which has been \\ndebited from the electronic credit ledger for making payment of such tax, \\nthe proper officer shall issue FORM GST PMT-03 re-crediting the said \\namount as Input Tax Credit in electronic credit ledger.” \\nClarification: The combined effect the abovementioned changes is that any \\nsuch refund of tax paid on supplies other than zero rated supplies will now be \\nadmissible proportionately in the respective original mode of payment i.e. in \\ncases of refund, where the tax to be refunded has been paid by debiting both \\nelectronic cash and credit ledgers (other than the refund of tax paid on zero-\\nrated supplies or deemed export), the refund to be paid in cash and credit \\nshall be calculated in the same proportion in which the cash and credit ledger \\nhas been debited for discharging the total tax liability for the relevant period \\nfor which application for refund has been filed. Such amount shall be \\naccordingly paid by issuance of order in FORM GST RFD-06 for amount \\nrefundable in cash and FORM GST PMT-03 to re-credit the amount \\nattributable to credit as ITC in the electronic credit ledger. \\n4. Guidelines for refunds of ITC under Section 54(3) of the CGST Act:- \\nIssue: In terms of para 36 of Master Refund Circular, the refund of ITC \\navailed in respect of invoices not reflected in FORM GSTR-2A was also \\nadmissible and copies of such invoices were required to be uploaded. \\nHowever, in wake of insertion of Rule 36(4) of the CGST Rules vide \\nnotification No. 49/2019-GST dated October 9, 2019, various references \\nwere received from the field formations regarding admissibility of refund of \\nthe ITC availed on the invoices which are not reflecting in the FORM GSTR-\\n2A of the applicant.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 16 \\nRefund under GST \\n437 \\n \\nClarification: The refund of accumulated ITC shall be restricted to the ITC \\nas per those invoices, the details of which are uploaded by the supplier in \\nFORM GSTR-1 and are reflected in the FORM GSTR-2A of the applicant. \\nAccordingly, para 36 of the Master Refund Circular stands modified to that \\nextent. \\n5. New Requirement to mention HSN/SAC in Annexure ‘B’ \\nIssue: References were received from the field formations that HSN wise \\ndetails of goods and services are not available in FORM GSTR-2A and \\ntherefore it becomes very difficult to distinguish ITC on capital goods and/or \\ninput services out of total ITC for a relevant tax period. It has been \\nrecommended that a column relating to HSN/SAC Code should be added in \\nthe statement of invoices relating to inward supply as provided in Annexure–\\nB of the Master Refund Circular so as to easily identify between the supplies \\nof goods and services. \\nClarification: Distinction is important in view of the provisions relating to \\nrefund where refund of credit on Capital goods and/or services is not \\npermissible in certain cases, it has been decided to amend the said statement. \\nAccordingly, Annexure-B of the Master Refund Circular stands modified to \\nthat extent. \\nA suitably modified statement format is attached for applicants to upload the \\ndetails of invoices reflecting in their FORM GSTR-2A. The applicant is, in \\naddition to details already prescribed, now required to mention HSN/SAC \\ncode which is mentioned on the inward invoices.

In order to clarify these issues and with a view to ensure \\nuniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the law across the field \\nformations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred by Section 168(1) of \\nthe Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (CGST Act for short) hereby \\nclarifies the issues raised as below:  \\n3. Claim for refund filed by an Input Service Distributor, a person paying tax \\nunder Section 10 or a non-resident taxable person :  \\n3.1 Doubts have been raised in case of claims for refund filed by an Input \\nService Distributor (ISD for short), a person paying tax under Section 10 of the \\nCGST Act (composition taxpayer for short)or a non-resident taxable person in \\nlight of para 2.0 of Circular No. 24/24/2017-GST, dated 21-12-2017 which \\nmandates that the refund claim for a tax period may be filed only after filing the \\ndetails in FORM GSTR-1 for the said tax period and that it is also to be ensured  \\nthat a valid return in FORM GSTR-3B has been filed for the last tax period \\nbefore the one in which the refund application is being filed.  \\n3.2 In this regard, attention is invited to sub-section (1) of Section 37 of the \\nCGST Act read with Rule 59 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017',\n",
              " 'Chap. 16 \\nRefund under GST \\n439 \\n \\n(CGST Rules for short) which mandates that every registered person, other than \\nan Input Service Distributor or a non-resident taxable person or a person paying \\ntax under the provisions of Section 10 or Section 51 or Section 52, shall furnish \\nthe details of outward supplies of goods or services or both effected during a tax \\nperiod in FORM GSTR-1. Further, as per sub-section (2) of Section 39 of the \\nCGST Act read with Rule 62 of the CGST Rules, a composition taxpayer is \\nrequired to furnish the return in FORM GSTR-4; as per sub-section (4) of \\nSection 39 of the CGST Act read with Rule 65 of the CGST Rules, an ISD is \\nrequired to furnish the return in FORM GSTR-6 and as per sub-section (5) of \\nSection 39 of the CGST Act read with Rule 63 of the CGST Rules, a non-\\nresident taxable person is required to furnish the return in FORM GSTR-5.  \\n3.3 Thus, it is clarified that in case of a claim for refund of balance in the \\nelectronic cash ledger filed by an ISD or a composition taxpayer; and the claim \\nfor refund of balance in the electronic cash and/or credit ledger by a non-resident \\ntaxable person, the filing of the details in FORM GSTR-1 and the return in \\nFORM GSTR-3B is not mandatory. Instead, the return in FORM GSTR-4 filed \\nby a composition taxpayer, the details in FORM GSTR-6 filed by an ISD and the \\nreturn in FORM GSTR-5 filed by a non-resident taxable person shall be \\nsufficient for claiming the said refund.  \\n4. Application for refund of integrated tax paid on export of services and \\nsupplies made to a Special Economic Zone developer or a Special Economic \\nZone unit :  \\n4.1 It has been represented that while filing the return in FORM GSTR-3B \\nfor a given tax period, certain registered persons committed errors in declaring \\nthe export of services on payment of integrated tax or zero rated supplies made to \\na Special Economic Zone developer or a Special Economic Zone unit on \\npayment of integrated tax. They have shown such supplies in the Table under \\ncolumn 3.1(a) instead of showing them in column 3.1(b) of FORM GSTR-3B \\nwhilst they have shown the correct details in Table 6A or 6B of FORM GSTR-1 \\nfor the relevant tax period and duly discharged their tax liabilities. Such \\nregistered persons are unable to file the refund application in FORM GST RFD-\\n01A for refund of integrated tax paid on the export of services or on supplies \\nmade to a SEZ developer or a SEZ unit on the GST common portal because of an \\nin-built validation check in the system which restricts the refund amount claimed \\n(integrated tax/cess) to the amount of integrated tax/cess mentioned under \\ncolumn 3.1(b) of FORM GSTR-3B (zero rated supplies) filed for the \\ncorresponding tax period.  \\n4.2 In this regard, it is clarified that for the tax periods commencing from 1-\\n7-2017 to 31-3-2018, such registered persons shall be allowed to file the refund \\napplication in FORM GST RFD-01A on the common portal subject to the \\ncondition that the amount of refund of integrated tax/cess claimed shall not be \\nmore than the aggregate amount of integrated tax/cess mentioned in the Table \\nunder columns 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 3.1(c) of FORM GSTR-3B filed for the \\ncorresponding tax period.',\n",

Refund of unutilized input tax credit of compensation cess availed on \\ninputs in cases where the final product is not subject to the levy of compensation \\ncess: \\n5.1 Doubts have been raised whether an exporter is eligible to claim refund \\nof unutilized input tax credit of compensation cess paid on inputs, where the final \\nproduct is not leviable to compensation cess. For instance, cess is levied on coal, \\nwhich is an input for the manufacture of aluminum products, whereas cess is not \\nlevied on aluminum products.  \\n5.2 In this regard, Section 16(2) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax \\nAct, 2017 (IGST Act for short) states that, subject to the provisions of Section \\n17(5) of the CGST Act, credit of input tax may be availed for making zero rated \\nsupplies. Further, as per Section 8 of the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation \\nto States) Act, 2017, (hereafter referred to as the Cess Act), all goods and \\nservices specified in the Schedule to the Cess Act are leviable to cess under the \\nCess Act; and vide Section 11(2) of the Cess Act, Section 16 of the IGST Act is \\nmutatis mutandis made applicable to inter-State supplies of all such goods and \\nservices. Thus, it implies that all supplies of such goods and services are zero \\nrated under the Cess Act. Moreover, as Section 17(5) of the CGST Act does not \\nrestrict the availment of input tax credit of compensation cess on coal, it is \\nclarified that a registered person making zero rated supply of aluminum products \\nunder bond or LUT may claim refund of unutilized credit including that of \\ncompensation cess paid on coal.  \\n5.3 Such registered persons may also make zero-rated supply of aluminum \\nproducts on payment of integrated tax but they cannot utilize the credit of the \\ncompensation cess paid on coal for payment of integrated tax in view of the \\nproviso to Section 11(2) of the Cess Act, which allows the utilization of the input \\ntax credit of cess, only for the payment of cess on the outward supplies. \\nAccordingly, they cannot claim refund of compensation cess in case of zero-rated \\nsupply on payment of Integrated Tax.  \\n6. Whether bond or Letter of Undertaking (LUT) is required in the case of \\nzero rated supply of exempted or non-GST goods and whether refund can be \\nclaimed by the exporter of exempted or non-GST goods?  \\n6.1 As per Section 16(2) of the IGST Act, credit of input tax may be availed \\nfor making zero rated supplies; notwithstanding that such supply is an exempt \\nsupply. Whereas, as per Section 2(47) of the CGST Act, exempt supply includes \\nnon-taxable supply. Further, as per Section 16(3) of the IGST Act, a registered \\nperson making zero rated supply shall be eligible to claim refund when he either \\nmakes supply of goods or services or both under bond or letter of undertaking \\n(LUT) or makes such supply on payment of integrated tax.  \\n6.2 However, in case of zero rated supply of exempted or non-GST goods, \\nthe requirement for furnishing a bond or LUT cannot be insisted upon. It is thus, \\nclarified that in respect of refund claims on account of export of non-GST and \\nexempted goods without payment of integrated tax; LUT/bond is not required. \\nSuch registered persons exporting non GST goods shall comply with the',\n",

This \\nis to ensure that the exporter does not utilise the input tax credit availed on other \\ndomestic supplies received for making the payment of integrated tax on export of \\ngoods.  \\n7.2 However, the said restriction is not applicable to an exporter who has \\nprocured goods from suppliers who have not availed the benefits of the specified \\nnotifications for making their outward supplies. Further, the said restriction is \\nalso not applicable to an exporter who has procured goods from suppliers who \\nhave, in turn, received goods from registered persons availing the benefits of \\nthese notifications since the exporter did not directly procure these goods without \\npayment of tax or at reduced rate of tax.  \\n7.3 Thus, the restriction under sub-rule (10) of Rule 96 of the CGST Rules is \\nonly applicable to those exporters who are directly receiving goods from those \\nsuppliers who are availing the benefit under Notification No. 48/2017-C.T., dated \\nthe 18th October, 2017, Notification No. 40/2017-C.T.

Whenever a registered person proceeds to claim refund in FORM GST \\nRFD-01A/RFD-01 under a category for a particular period on the common \\nportal, the system pops up a message box asking whether he wants to apply for \\n‘NIL’ refund for the selected period.

Prior to 31-12-2018, refund applications were being processed only after \\nsubmission of printed copies of FORM GST RFD-01A in the respective \\njurisdictional tax offices.

In case deficiencies are found, then the same are \\ncommunicated to the assessee, requiring the assessee to file a fresh refund \\napplication after rectifying those deficiencies.

This would also be construed as rejection of the petitioner’s \\ninitial refund application as it would require a fresh refund application to be filed \\nby the petitioner after rectifying the alleged deficiencies.

              " 'Chap. 19 \\nInspection, Search, Seizure and Arrest \\n485 \\n\"We may note that personal liberty is an important aspect of our \\nconstitutional mandate. The occasion to arrest an accused during \\ninvestigation arises when custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a \\nheinous crime or where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or \\naccused may abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is \\nlawful does not mandate that arrest must be made. A distinction must be \\nmade between the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for \\nexercise of it. If arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm to the \\nreputation and self-esteem of a person. If the Investigating Officer has no \\nreason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons and has, \\nin fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation we fail to appreciate \\nwhy there should be a compulsion on the officer to arrest the accused.\" \\nBoard has examined the above-mentioned judgment and has felt the need to \\nissue guidelines with respect to arrest under CGST Act, 2017. Even, under legacy \\nlaws i.e. Central Excise Act, 1944 (1 of 1944) and Chapter V of the Finance Act, \\n1994 (32 of 1994), the instructions regarding exercise of power to arrest had been \\nissued. \\nConditions precedent to arrest: \\nSub-section (1) of Section 132 of CGST Act, 2017 deals with the punishment \\nfor offences specified therein. Sub-section (1) of Section 69 gives the power to \\nthe Commissioner to arrest a person where he has reason to believe that the \\nalleged offender has committed any offence specified in clause (a) or clause (b) \\nor clause (c) or clause (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 132 which is punishable \\nunder clause (i) or clause (ii) of sub section (1), or sub-section (2) of the Section \\n132 of CGST Act, 2017. Therefore, before placing a person under arrest, the \\nlegal requirements must be fulfilled. The reasons to believe to arrive at a decision \\nto place an alleged offender under arrest must be unambiguous and amply clear. \\nThe reasons to believe must be based on credible material. \\nSince arrest impinges on the personal liberty of an individual, the power to \\narrest must be exercised carefully. The arrest should not be made in routine and \\nmechanical manner. Even if all the legal conditions precedent to arrest mentioned \\nin Section 132 of the CGST Act, 2017 are fulfilled, that will not, ipso facto, mean \\nthat an arrest must be made. Once the legal ingredients of the offence are made \\nout, the Commissioner or the competent authority must then determine if the \\nanswer to any or some of the following questions is in the affirmative: \\nWhether the person was concerned in the non-bailable offence or credible \\ninformation has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists, of his having \\nbeen so concerned? \\nWhether arrest is necessary to ensure proper investigation of the offence? \\nWhether the person, if not restricted, is likely to tamper the course of further \\ninvestigation or is likely to tamper with evidence or intimidate or influence \\nwitnesses?',\n",
              " \"486 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 19 \\nWhether person is mastermind or key operator effecting proxy/benami \\ntransaction in the name of dummy GSTIN or non-existent persons, etc. for \\npassing fraudulent input tax credit etc.? \\nAs unless such person is arrested, his presence before investigating officer \\ncannot be ensured. \\nApproval to arrest should be granted only where the intent to evade tax or \\ncommit acts leading to availment or utilization of wrongful Input Tax Credit or \\nfraudulent refund of tax or failure to pay amount collected as tax as specified in \\nsub-section (1) of Section 132 of the CGST Act 2017, is evident and element of \\nmens rea/guilty mind is palpable. \\nThus, the relevant factors before deciding to arrest a person, apart from \\nfulfillment of the legal requirements, must be that the need to ensure proper \\ninvestigation and prevent the possibility of tampering with evidence or \\nintimidating or influencing witnesses exists. \\nArrest should, however, not be resorted to in cases of technical nature i.e. \\nwhere the demand of tax is based on a difference of opinion regarding \\ninterpretation of Law. The prevalent practice of assessment could also be one of \\nthe determining factors while ascribing intention to evade tax to the alleged \\noffender. Other factors influencing the decision to arrest could be if the alleged \\noffender is co-operating in the investigation, viz. compliance to summons, \\nfurnishing of documents called for, not giving evasive replies, voluntary payment \\nof tax etc. \\nProcedure for arrest \\nPr. Commissioner/Commissioner shall record on file that after considering \\nthe nature of offence, the role of person involved and evidence available, he has \\nreason to believe that the person has committed an offence as mentioned in \\nSection 132 and may authorize an officer of central tax to arrest the concerned \\nperson(s). The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) \\nread with section 69(3) of CGST Act relating to arrest and the procedure thereof, \\nmust be adhered to. It is, therefore, advised that the Pr. Commissioner/ \\nCommissioner should ensure that all officers are fully familiar with the \\nprovisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974). \\nThe arrest memo must be in compliance with the directions of Hon'ble \\nSupreme Court in the case of D.K Basu vs State of West Bengal reported in \\n1997(1) SCC 416 (see paragraph 35).

They should be summoned when there are \\nclear indications in the investigation of their involvement in the decision \\nmaking process which led to loss of revenue. \\n (vii)  Attention is also invited to Board's Circular No. 122/41/2019-GST dated \\nNovember 05, 2019 which makes generation and quoting of Document \\nIdentification Number (DIN) mandatory on communication issued by \\nofficers of CBIC to tax payers and other concerned persons for the \\npurpose of investigation. Format of summons has been prescribed under \\nBoard's Circular No. 128/47/2019-GST dated December 23, 2019. \\n (viii)  The summoning officer must be present at the time and date for which \\nsummons is issued. In case of any exigency, the summoned person must \\nbe informed in advance in writing or orally. \\n (ix)  All persons summoned are bound to appear before the officers \\nconcerned, the only exception being women who do not by tradition \\nappear in public or privileged persons. The exemption so available to \\nthese persons under Section 132 and 133 of CPC may be kept in \\nconsideration while investigating the case. \\n \\n(x)  Issuance of repeated summons without ensuring service of the summons \\nmust be avoided.

Section 132 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (CGST Act, \\n2017) codifies the offences under the Act which warrant institution of criminal \\nproceedings and prosecution. Whoever commits any of the offences specified \\nunder sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of section 132 of the CGST Act, 2017, \\ncan be prosecuted.  \\n3. Sanction of prosecution:  \\n3.1 Sanction of prosecution has serious repercussions for the person \\ninvolved, therefore, the nature of evidence collected during the investigation \\nshould be carefully assessed. One of the important considerations for deciding \\nwhether prosecution should be launched is the availability of adequate evidence. \\nThe standard of proof required in a criminal prosecution is higher than \\nadjudication proceeding as the case has to be established beyond reasonable \\ndoubt. Therefore, even cases where demand is confirmed in adjudication \\nproceedings, evidence collected should be weighed so as to likely meet the above \\ncriteria for recommending prosecution. Decision should be taken on case-to-case \\nbasis considering various factors, such as, nature and gravity of offence, quantum \\nof tax evaded, or ITC wrongly availed, or refund wrongly taken and the nature as \\nwell as quality of evidence collected.',\n",
              " '492 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 19 \\n3.2. Prosecution should not be filed merely because a demand has been \\nconfirmed in the adjudication proceedings. Prosecution should not be launched in \\ncases of technical nature, or where additional claim of tax is based on a \\ndifference of opinion regarding interpretation of law. Further, the evidence \\ncollected should be adequate to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the person \\nhad guilty mind, knowledge of the offence, or had fraudulent intention or in any \\nmanner possessed mens-rea for committing the offence. It follows, therefore, that \\nin the case of public limited companies, prosecution should not be launched \\nindiscriminately against all the Directors of the company but should be restricted \\nto only persons who oversaw day-to-day operations of the company and have \\ntaken active part in committing the tax evasion etc. or had connived at it.  \\n4. Decision on prosecution should normally be taken immediately on \\ncompletion of the adjudication proceedings, except in cases of arrest where \\nprosecution should be filed as early as possible. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India \\nin the case of Radheshyam Kejriwal [2011 (266) ELT 294 (SC)] has, inter-alia, \\nobserved the following: \\n(i) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings can be launched \\nsimultaneously;  \\n(ii) Decision in adjudication proceedings is not necessary before initiating \\ncriminal prosecution;  \\n(iii) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are independent in \\nnature to each other;  \\n(iv) The findings against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication \\nproceedings is not binding on the proceeding for criminal prosecution; \\n(v) The finding in the adjudication proceedings in favour of the person \\nfacing trial for identical violation will depend upon the nature of finding. \\nIf the exoneration in adjudication proceedings is on technical ground and \\nnot on merit, prosecution may continue; and \\n(vi) In case of exoneration, however, on merits where the allegation is found \\nto be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent, criminal \\nprosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances cannot be allowed \\nto continue, the underlying principle being the higher standard of proof \\nin criminal cases. \\nIn view of the above observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court, prosecution \\ncomplaint may even be filed before adjudication of the case, especially where \\noffence involved is grave, or qualitative evidences are available, or it is \\napprehended that the concerned person may delay completion of adjudication \\nproceedings. In cases where any offender is arrested under section 69 of the \\nCGST Act, 2017, prosecution complaint may be filed even before issuance of the \\nShow Cause Notice.  \\n5. Monetary limits:  \\n5.1 Monetary Limit: Prosecution should normally be launched where amount \\nof tax evasion, or misuse of ITC, or fraudulently obtained refund in relation to',\n",

However, in following cases, the said \\nmonetary limit shall not be applicable:  \\n(i) Habitual evaders: Prosecution can be launched in the case of a \\ncompany/taxpayer habitually involved in tax evasion or misusing Input \\nTax Credit (ITC) facility or fraudulently obtained refund. A \\ncompany/taxpayer would be treated as habitual evader, if it has been \\ninvolved in two or more cases of confirmed demand (at the first \\nadjudication level or above) of tax evasion/fraudulent refund or misuse \\nof ITC involving fraud, suppression of facts etc. in past two years such \\nthat the total tax evaded and/or total ITC misused and/or fraudulently \\nobtained refund exceeds Five Hundred Lakh rupees. DIGIT database \\nmay be used to identify such habitual evaders.  \\n(ii)  Arrest Cases: Cases where during the course of investigation, arrests \\nhave been made under section 69 of the CGST Act.  \\n6. Authority to sanction prosecution: \\n6.1 The prosecution complaint for prosecuting a person should be filed only \\nafter obtaining the sanction of the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner of CGST in \\nterms of sub-section (6) of section 132 of CGST Act, 2017.  \\n6.2 In respect of cases investigated by DGGI, the prosecution complaint for \\nprosecuting a person should be filed only after obtaining the sanction of Pr. \\nAdditional Director General/Additional Director General, Directorate General of \\nGST Intelligence (DGGI) of the concerned zonal unit/Hqrs.  \\n7. Procedure for sanction of prosecution: \\n7.1 In cases of arrest(s) made under section 69 of the CGST Act, 2017:  \\n7.1.1 Where during the course of investigation, arrest(s) have been made and \\nno bail has been granted, all efforts should be made to file prosecution complaint \\nin the Court within sixty (60) days of arrest. In all other cases of arrest, \\nprosecution complaint should also be filed within a definite time frame. The \\nproposal of filing complaint in the format of investigation report prescribed in \\nAnnexure-I, should be forwarded to the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner, within \\nfifty (50) days of arrest. The Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner shall examine the \\nproposal and take decision as per section 132 of CGST Act, 2017. If prosecution \\nsanction is accorded, he shall issue a sanction order along with an order \\nauthorizing the investigating officer (at the level of Superintendent) of the case to \\nfile the prosecution complaint in the competent court.  \\n7.1.2 In cases investigated by DGGI wherever an arrest has been made, \\nprocedure as detailed in para 7.1.1 should be followed by officers of equivalent \\nrank of DGGI.  \\n7.1.3 The Additional/Joint Commissioner or Additional/Joint Director in the \\ncase of DGGI, must ensure that all the documents/evidence and list of witnesses \\nare kept ready before forwarding the proposal of filing complaint to Pr. \\nCommissioner/Commissioner or Pr.

Section 137 (2) of the Act provides that where an offence \\nunder this Act has been committed by a company and it is proved that the offence \\nhas been committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to any \\nneglect on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the \\ncompany, such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall be deemed to be \\nguilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished \\naccordingly. Thus, in the case of Companies, both the legal person as well as \\nnatural person are liable for prosecution under section 132 of the CGST Act. \\nSimilarly, under sub-section (3) of section 137, the provisions have been made \\nfor partnership firm or a Limited Liability Partnership or a Hindu Undivided \\nFamily or a Trust.  \\n7.2.2 Where it is deemed fit to launch prosecution before adjudication of the \\ncase, the Additional/Joint Commissioner or Additional/Joint Director, DGGI, as \\nthe case may be, supervising the investigation, shall record the reason for the \\nsame and forward the proposal to the sanctioning authority. The decision of the \\nsanctioning authority shall be informed to the concerned adjudicating authority \\nso that there is no need for him to examine the case again from the perspective of \\nprosecution. \\n7.2.3 In all cases (other than those mentioned at para 7.2.2 and arrests where \\nprosecution complaint has already been filed before adjudication), the \\nadjudicating authority should invariably indicate at the time of passing the order \\nitself whether it considers the case fit for prosecution, so that it can be further \\nprocessed and sent to the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner for obtaining his \\nsanction of prosecution.  \\n7.2.4 In cases, where Show Cause Notice has been issued by DGGI, the \\nrecommendation of adjudicating authority for filing of prosecution shall be sent \\nto the Pr. Additional Director General/Additional Director General, DGGI of the \\nconcerned zonal unit/Hqrs.  \\n7.2.5 Where at the time of passing of adjudication order, no view has been \\ntaken on prosecution by the Adjudicating Authority, the adjudication branch shall \\nre-submit the 5 file within 15 days from the date of issue of adjudication order to \\nthe Adjudicating Authority to take view on prosecution.  \\n7.2.6 Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner or Pr. Additional Director General/ \\nAdditional Director General of DGGI may on his own motion also, taking into \\nconsideration inter alia, the seriousness of the offence, examine whether the case \\nis fit for sanction of prosecution irrespective of whether the adjudicating \\nauthority has recommended prosecution or not.',\n",

Additional Director General/Additional Director General of \\nDGGI for taking a decision on sanction for launching prosecution. Thereafter, the \\ncompetent authority shall follow the procedure as mentioned in para 7.1.1.  \\n7.2.8 Once the sanction for prosecution has been obtained, prosecution in the \\ncourt of law should be filed as early as possible, but not beyond a period of sixty \\ndays by the duly authorized officer (of the level of Superintendent). In case of \\ndelay in filing complaint beyond 60 days, the reason for the same shall be \\nbrought to the notice of the sanctioning authority i.e., Pr. Commissioner/ \\nCommissioner or Pr.

Procedure for withdrawal of prosecution:  \\n9.1 Procedure for withdrawal of sanction-order of prosecution: \\n9.1.1 In cases where prosecution has been sanctioned but complaint has not \\nbeen filed and new facts or evidence have come to light necessitating review of \\nthe sanction for prosecution, the Commissionerate should immediately bring the \\nsame to the notice of the sanctioning authority. After considering the new facts \\nand evidence, the sanctioning authority, if satisfied, may recommend to the \\njurisdictional Pr. Chief Commissioner/Chief Commissioner that the sanction for \\nprosecution be withdrawn who shall then take a decision.  \\n9.1.2 In the cases investigated by DGGI, such withdrawal of sanction order \\nmay be made with the approval of Director General of DGGI of concerned sub-\\nnational unit. In the cases booked by DGGI, Hqrs., Pr. Director General shall be \\ncompetent to approve the withdrawal of sanction order.  \\n9.2 Procedure for withdrawal of complaint already filed for prosecution: \\n9.2.1 Attention is invited to judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court on the issue \\nof relation between adjudication proceedings and prosecution in the case of \\nRadheshyam Kejriwal, supra. Hon’ble Supreme Court in para 43 have observed \\nas below: “In our opinion, therefore, the yardstick would be to judge as to \\nwhether allegation in the adjudication proceeding as well as proceeding for \\nprosecution is identical and the exoneration of the person concerned in the \\nadjudication proceeding is on merits. In case it is found on merit that there is no \\ncontravention of the provisions of the Act in the adjudication proceeding, the trial \\nof the person concerned shall be in abuse of the process of the court.”  \\nThe said ratio is equally applicable to GST Law. Therefore, where it is found \\non merit that there is no contravention of the provisions of the Act in the \\nadjudication proceedings and such order has attained finality, Pr. Commissioner/ \\nCommissioner or Pr. Additional Director General/Additional Director General \\nafter taking approval of Pr. Chief Commissioner/Chief Commissioner or Pr. \\nDirector General/Director General, as the case may be, would ensure filing of an \\napplication through Public Prosecutor in the court to allow withdrawal of \\nprosecution in accordance with law. The withdrawal can only be affected with \\nthe approval of the court.  \\n10. General guidelines: \\n10.1 It has been reported that delay in the Court proceedings is often due to \\nnon-availability of the records required to be produced before the Court or due to \\ndelay in drafting of the complaint, listing of the exhibits etc. It shall be the \\nresponsibility of the officer who has been authorized to file complaint, to take \\ncharge of all documents, statements and other exhibits that would be required to \\nbe produced before a Court. The list of exhibits etc. should be finalized in \\nconsultation with the Public Prosecutor at the time of drafting of the complaint. \\nNo time should be lost in ensuring that all exhibits are kept in safe custody. \\nWhere a complaint has not been filed even after a lapse of 60 days from the \\nreceipt of sanction for prosecution, the reason for delay shall be brought to the',\n",

Additional Director \\nGeneral/Additional Director General of DGGI by the Additional/Joint \\nCommissioner in charge of the Commissionerate or Additional/Joint Director of \\nDGGI, responsible for filing of the complaint.  \\n10.2 Filing of prosecution need not be kept in abeyance on the ground that \\nthe taxpayer has gone in appeal/revision. However, to ensure that the proceeding \\nin appeal/revision are not unduly delayed because the case records are required \\nfor the purpose of prosecution, a parallel file containing copies of essential \\ndocuments relating to adjudication should be maintained.  \\n10.3 The Superintendent in-charge of adjudication section should endorse \\ncopy of all adjudication orders to the prosecution section. The Superintendent in \\ncharge of prosecution section should monitor receipt of all serially numbered \\nadjudication orders and obtain copies of adjudication orders of missing serial \\nnumbers from the adjudication section every month. In respect of adjudication \\norders related to DGGI cases, Superintendent in charge of adjudication section \\nshould ensure endorsing a copy of adjudication order to DGGI. Concerned Zonal \\nUnits/Hqrs. of DGGI shall also follow up the status of adjudication of the case \\nfrom the concerned Commissionerate or adjudicating authority. \\n11. Publication of names of persons convicted: \\n11.1 Section 159 of the CGST Act, 2017 grants power to the Pr. \\nCommissioner/Commissioner or any other officer authorised by him on his \\nbehalf to publish name and other particulars of the person convicted under the \\nAct. It is directed that in deserving cases, the department should invoke this \\nsection in respect of all persons who are convicted under the Act.  \\n12. Monitoring of prosecution: \\n12.1 Prosecution, once launched, should be vigorously followed. The Pr. \\nCommissioner/Commissioner of CGST or Pr. Additional Director General/ \\nAdditional Director General of DGGI should monitor cases of prosecution at \\nmonthly intervals and take the corrective action wherever necessary to ensure \\nthat the progress of prosecution is satisfactory. In DGGI, an Additional/Joint \\nDirector in each zonal unit and DGGI (Hqrs) shall supervise the prosecution \\nrelated work and take stock of the pending prosecution cases. For keeping a track \\nof prosecution cases, entries of all prosecution cases should promptly be made in \\nDIGIT/Investigation Module, within 48 hours of sanction of prosecution and the \\nentries must be updated from time to time. Additional/Joint Commissioner or \\nAdditional/Joint Director, in-charge of supervising prosecution cases shall ensure \\nmaking timely entries in the database. \\n13. Compounding of offence:  \\n13.1 Section 138 of the CGST Act, 2017 provides for compounding of \\noffences by the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner on payment of compounding \\namount.

Transitional Provisions: \\n14.1 All cases where sanction for prosecution is accorded after the issue of \\nthese instructions shall be dealt in accordance with the provisions of these \\ninstructions irrespective of the date of the offence. Cases where prosecution has \\nbeen sanctioned but no complaint has been filed before the magistrate shall also \\nbe reviewed by the prosecution sanctioning authority considering the provisions \\nof these instructions.  \\n15. Inspection of prosecution work by the Directorate General of \\nPerformance Management: \\n15.1 Director General, Directorate General of Performance Management and \\nPr. Chief Commissioners/Chief Commissioners, who are required to inspect the \\nCommissionerate, should specifically check whether instructions in this regard \\nare being followed scrupulously and make a mention of the implementation of \\nthe guidelines in their inspection report apart from recording of statistical data. \\nSimilarly exercise should also be carried out in DGGI. \\n16. Where a cause is considered suitable for launching prosecution and \\nwhere adequate evidence is forthcoming, securing conviction largely depends on \\nthe quality of investigation. It is, therefore, necessary for senior officers to take \\npersonal interest in the investigation of important cases of GST evasion and in \\nrespect of cases having money laundering angle and to provide guidance and \\nsupport to the investigating officers. \\n17. To ensure proper training to the officers posted for prosecution work, the \\nPr. Director General, National Academy of Customs, Indirect Taxes and \\nNarcotics (NACIN), Faridabad, should organize separate training courses on \\nprosecution/arrest etc. from time to time and should incorporate a series of \\nlectures on this issue in the courses organized for investigation.

Kanishka Matta v Union of India (2020) 120 taxmann.com 174 (Madhya \\nPradesh)] \\nThe issue before the Hon’ble Madhya Pradesh High Court for consideration \\ninvolves determination of expression ‘things' under Section 67(2) of the CGST \\nAct whether includes cash or not. \\nThe petitioner is the wife of the proprietor of the firm functioning in the \\nname and style of M/s. S. S. Enterprises. The firm is in the business of \\nConfectionery and Pan Masala items. Search operation was carried out at the \\nbusiness premises as well as residential premises by the Department and cash of \\naround ` 66 lakhs were seized. \\nThe petitioner contended that the department is not competent to seize the \\ncash under Section 67(2) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \\n(‘CGST Act’) since cash cannot be treated as document, book or things. \\nTherefore, the department should be directed to release the cash seized by it. \\nThe Hon’ble Madras High Court on going through the provisions of Section \\n67(2) of the CGST Act observed that the said section provides that confiscation \\nof any documents or books or things, secreted in any place, which in the opinion\",\n",

The meaning of the word ‘things’ needs to be seen widely and would \\ninclude ‘money’ as well. Further, interpretation of statute must be adopted in a \\nway that anomaly is avoided and which suppresses the mischief and advances the \\nremedy. \\nTherefore, in view of interpretation of the word ‘thing’, money shall be \\nincluded and hence, the cash has been rightly seized by the department from the \\npetitioner. Further, unless and until the investigation is carried out and the matter \\nis finally adjudicated, the question of releasing the amount does not arise. \\n* \\n* \\n* \\nSearch not justified as officers stayed in assessee’s premises for 8 days & \\nrestricted movement of family members:  \\n[Paresh Nathalal Chauhan v State of Gujarat [2020] 113 taxmann.com 462 \\n(Gujarat)] \\nSearch was conducted at the residential premises of the assessee which went \\non from 11.10.2019 to 18.10.2019. The search party camped in the residential \\npremises of the assessee for 8 days, during which the family members of the \\nassessee were confined to the searched premises and were not permitted to leave \\nthe premises without the permission of the authorized officer. The assessee filed \\nan application before the High Court of Gujarat challenging the validity and \\nnature of the search proceedings conducted at his premises. \\nThe Hon’ble High Court observed that as per the panchnama, the family \\nmembers of the assessee were under house arrest for 8 days. There is no \\nprovision under the GST Act which empower the authorized officer to confine \\nfamily members in this manner and to interrogate them day and night. In the \\ngiven case, the authorization was for search and seizure of goods liable for \\nconfiscation, documents, books or things. Continuous stay of the officers for so \\nmany days was not for search of the premises but to search the assessee to obtain \\ninformation of the place where the documents could have been secreted by him, \\nwas totally unauthorized as it was not backed by any statutory provision. Hence, \\nthe concerned officer converted it into a search for a person and investigation, \\nwhich was not backed by any statutory provision. \\nThus, apart from the illegality of the continuation of the search proceedings, \\nthe conduct of the search officers in confining the family members of the \\nassessee to the house and interrogating them again and again was completely \\nblatant abuse of powers. \\nIn view of the above, the Hon’ble High Court held the search and seizure \\nconducted at the premises of the assessee was illegal and not justified \\n* \\n* \\n* \\nWrit petitions could not be filed before HC against seizure orders: SC  \\n[State of Uttar Pradesh v Kay Pan Fragrance (P.)

The CGST Act read with CGST Rules contains a \\ncomplete code for release (including provisional release) of seized goods. \\nTherefore, the orders passed by the High Court are held contrary to the \\nprovisions prescribed and such order would not be given effect and to be \\nprocessed by the authorities afresh in accordance with law. \\n******* \\nCash cannot be seized during search of premises: \\nThe Hon’ble High Court of Kerala in the case of Shabu George v State Tax \\nOfficer, reported in (2023) 9 Centax 28 (Ker.), held that While it may be a fact \\nthat Section 67(2) of the CGST Act authorizes the seizure of things, including \\ncash in appropriate cases, we do not think that the present is a case that called for \\na seizure of the cash found in the premises of the appellants at the time of the \\nsearch. The power of any authority to seize any 'thing' while functioning under \\nthe provisions of a taxing statute must be guided and informed in its exercise by \\nthe object of the statute concerned. In an investigation aimed at detecting tax eva-\\nsion under the GST Act, we fail to see how cash can be seized especially when it \\nis the admitted case that the cash did not form part of the stock in trade of the \\nappellant's business. It is evident from the order of the Intelligence Officer that \\nthe cash that was seized from the premises of the appellants was not the stock in \\ntrade of the quarry business that was conducted by the appellant. The findings of \\nthe Intelligence Officer that 'it is suspicious that this much amount of money kept \\nin the house of M/s. Shabu as idle and not deposited at bank' and further 'the \\namount received as gift on the day of marriage has not been recorded in his in-\\ncome tax return and from this it is evident that the money is from illicit sources' \\nreveal the extent to which authorities under the Act are misinformed of their \\npowers and the limits of their jurisdiction. The aforesaid findings of the Intelli-\\ngence Officer could perhaps have been justified had he been an officer attached \\nto the Income-tax department. In the context of the GST Act, the findings are \\nwholly irrelevant. We find that the seizure of cash from the premises of the ap-\\npellants was wholly uncalled for and unwarranted. Moreover, as the respondent \\nhas retained the seized cash for more than six months and is yet to issue a show \\ncause notice to the appellants in connection with the investigation, there can be \\nno justification for a continued retention of the said amount with the respondent. \\nWe therefore, allow this appeal by directing the first respondent to forthwith re-\\nlease to the appellant the cash seized from the premises, against a receipt to be \\nobtained from him. The amount shall be released to the appellant without any \\ndelay, and at any rate, within a week from the date of receipt of a copy of this \\njudgment. (Para.3).\",\n",

For example, the person may have made a typographical \\nerror or may have wrongly reported any detail in GSTR-1 or GSTR-3B. Such \\nerrors or omissions can be rectified by the said person in a subsequent GSTR-1/ \\nGSTR-3B as per the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 37 or the provisions \\nof sub-section (9) of section 39, as the case may be. There may also be cases, \\nwhere a supply could not be declared by the registered person in GSTR-1 of an \\nearlier tax period, though the tax on the same was paid by correctly reporting the',\n",

In such cases, there \\ncould be a mis-match between GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B (liability reported in \\nGSTR-1> tax paid in GSTR-3B) in the current tax period. Therefore, in all such \\ncases, an opportunity needs to be provided to the concerned registered person to \\nexplain the differences between GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B, if any, and for short \\npayment or non-payment of the amount of self-assessed tax liability, and interest \\nthereon, before any action under section 79 of the Act is taken for recovery of the \\nsaid amount. \\nAccordingly, where ever any such amount of tax, self-assessed by the \\nregistered person in his outward supply statement GSTR-1 is found to be short \\npaid or not paid by the said person through his GSTR-3B return in terms of the \\nprovisions of sub-section (12) of section 75 of the Act, the proper officer may \\nsend a communication (with DIN, in terms of guidelines issued vide Circular No. \\n122/41/2019-GST dated November 05, 2019) to the registered person to pay the \\namount short paid or not paid, or to explain the reasons for such short payment or \\nnon-payment of self-assessed tax, within a reasonable time, as prescribed in the \\ncommunication. If, the concerned person is able to justify the differences \\nbetween GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B, or is able to explain the reasons of such short-\\npayment or non-payment of tax, to the satisfaction of the proper officer, or pays \\nthe amount such short paid or not paid, then there may not be any requirement to \\ninitiate proceedings for recovery under section 79. \\nHowever, if the said registered person either fails to reply to the proper \\nofficer, or fails to make the payment of such amount short paid or not paid, \\nwithin the time prescribed in the communication or such further period as may be \\npermitted by the proper officer, then the proceedings for recovery of the said \\namount as per provisions of section 79 may be initiated by the proper officer. \\nFurther, where the said registered person fails to explain the reasons for such \\ndifference/ short payment of tax to the satisfaction of the proper officer, then the \\nproper officer may proceed for recovery of the said amount as per provisions of \\nsection 79. \\n* \\n* \\n* \\nC.B.I & C, Instruction No.4/2023 dated 23.11.2023 \\nServing of the summary of notice in FORM GST DRC-01 and uploading of \\nsummary of order in FORM GST DRC-07 electronically on the portal by \\nthe proper officer-regarding. \\nReference is invited to the provisions of section 52, section 73, section 74, \\nsection 122, section 123, section 124, section 125, section 127, section 129 and \\nsection 130 of Central Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 (herein after referred to \\nas the CGST Act), as per which a notice is required to be issued by the proper \\nofficer to a person for demand and recovery of any amount of tax not paid or \\nshort paid/amount of input tax credit wrongly availed/amount of refund \\nerroneously made, for recovery of interest and/ or for imposition of any penalty \\nor fine on the said person.

The \\nwrit application was filed to seek relief in this regard. \\nThe Hon’ble High Court observed that as per Section 73(1) of the Central \\nGoods and Services Tax Act (‘CGST Act’), if tax had not been paid or had been \\nshort paid, a notice was required to be served by the Proper Officer on the \\nassessee. The said notice would not only require him to show cause as to why tax \\nshould not be recovered from it, but should also specify the interest payable \\nunder Section 50 will also be recovered along with penalty. Thus, if there was a \\nshort payment of tax or non-payment of tax, a notice was required to be issued \\neven for recovery of interest under Section 50 of the CGST Act. \\nThe interest liability under Section 50 is required to be calculated and \\nintimated to assessee. If the assessee disputes the calculation of interest or the \\nleviability of interest, then only the Assessing Officer can initiate proceedings \\neither under Section 73 or 74 of the CGST Act for adjudication of interest \\nliability. \\nMoreover, Section 79 of the CGST Act empower the authorities to initiate \\ngarnishee proceedings for recovery of tax wherein any amount payable by a \\nperson to the Government under any of the provisions of the Act and Rules made \\nis not paid. Even though the liability of interest is automatic, but the same is \\nrequired to be adjudicated when assessee dispute the computation or leviability \\nof interest, by initiation of adjudication proceedings. Until such adjudication was \\ncompleted by the Proper Officer, the amount of interest could not be termed as an \\namount payable under GST. Therefore, without initiation of any adjudication \\nproceedings, no recovery proceeding under Section 79 of the Act could be \\ninitiated for recovery of the interest amount. The Honourable High Court set \\naside the letter demanding interest as well as notice initiating recovery \\nproceedings.',\n",

CBIC Circular on Limitation of filing Appeal \\nC.B.I & C. Circular No. 132/2/2020-GST, dated 18-3-2020. \\nClarification in respect of appeal in regard to non-constitution of Appellate \\nTribunal: \\nVarious representations have been received wherein the issue has been \\ndecided against the registered person by the adjudicating authority or refund \\napplication has been rejected by the appropriate authority and appeal against the \\nsaid order is pending before the appellate authority. It has been gathered that the \\nappellate process is being kept pending by several appellate authorities on the \\ngrounds that the appellate tribunal has been not constituted and that till such time \\nno remedy is available against their Order-in-Appeal, such appeals cannot be \\ndisposed. Doubts have been raised across the field formations in respect of the \\nappropriate procedure to be followed in absence of appellate tribunal for appeal \\nto be made under section 112 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \\n(hereinafter referred to as the “CGST Act”).  \\n2. The matter has been examined in detail. In order to clarify the issue and to \\nensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the law across field \\nformations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred by section 168(1) of \\nthe CGST Act, hereby issues the following clarifications and guidelines.  \\n3.1 Appeal against an adjudicating authority is to be made as per the \\nprovisions of Section 107 of the CGST Act. The sub-section (1) of the section \\nreads as follows:— \\n“107. (1) Any person aggrieved by any decision or order passed under \\nthis Act or the State Goods and Services Tax Act or the Union Territory',\n",
              " 'Chap. 22 \\nAppeals and Revision \\n587 \\nGoods and Services Tax Act by an adjudicating authority may appeal to such \\nAppellate Authority as may be prescribed within three months from the date \\non which the said decision or order is communicated to such person.” \\n3.2 Relevant rules have been prescribed for implementation of the above \\nSection. The relevant rule for the same is rule 109A of Central Goods and \\nServices Tax Rules, 2017 which reads as follows: \\n“109A. Appointment of Appellate Authority.—(1) Any person aggrieved \\nby any decision or order passed under this Act or the State Goods and \\nServices Tax Act or the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Act may \\nappeal to — (a) the Commissioner (Appeals) where such decision or order is \\npassed by the Additional or Joint Commissioner; (b) any officer not below \\nthe rank of Joint Commissioner (Appeals) where such decision or order is \\npassed by the Deputy or Assistant Commissioner or Superintendent, within \\nthree months from the date on which the said decision or order is \\ncommunicated to such person.” \\n3.3 Hence, if the order has been passed by Deputy or Assistant \\nCommissioner or Superintendent, appeal has to be made to the appellate \\nauthority appointed who would not be an officer below the rank of Joint \\nCommissioner. Further, if the order has been passed by Additional or Joint \\nCommissioner, appeal has to be made to the Commissioner (Appeal) appointed \\nfor the same. \\n4.1 The appeal against the order passed by appellate authority under Section \\n107 of the CGST Act lies with appellate tribunal. Relevant provisions for the \\nsame is mentioned in the Section 112 of the CGST Act which reads as follows:—  \\n“112 (1) Any person aggrieved by an order passed against him under \\nsection 107 or section 108 of this Act or the State Goods and Services Tax \\nAct or the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Act may appeal to the \\nAppellate Tribunal against such order within three months from the date on \\nwhich the order sought to be appealed against is communicated to the person \\npreferring the appeal.” \\n4.2 The appellate tribunal has not been constituted in view of the order by \\nMadras High Court in case of Revenue Bar Assn. v. Union of India and therefore \\nthe appeal cannot be filed within three months from the date on which the order \\nsought to be appealed against is communicated. In order to remove difficulty \\narising in giving effect to the above provision of the Act, the Government, on the \\nrecommendations of the Council, has issued the Central Goods and Services Tax \\n(Ninth Removal of Difficulties) Order, 2019, dated 03.12.2019. It has been \\nprovided through the said Order that the appeal to tribunal can be made within \\nthree months (six months in case of appeals by the Government) from the date of \\ncommunication of order or date on which the President or the State President, as \\nthe case may be, of the Appellate Tribunal enters office, whichever is later.  \\n4.3 Hence, as of now, the prescribed time limit to make application to \\nappellate tribunal will be counted from the date on which President or the State \\nPresident enters office. The appellate authority while passing order may mention',\n",
              " '588 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 22 \\nin the preamble that appeal may be made to the appellate tribunal whenever it is \\nconstituted within three months from the President or the State President enters \\noffice. Accordingly, it is advised that the appellate authorities may dispose all \\npending appeals expeditiously without waiting for the constitution of the \\nappellate tribunal. \\n18. Appeal to High Court  \\nSection 117 of the CGST Act, 2017 deals with the provision of appeal to \\nHigh Court, any person aggrieved by any order passed by the State Benches of \\nthe Appellate Tribunal may file an appeal to the High Court and the High Court \\nmay admit such appeal, if it is satisfied that the case involves a substantial \\nquestion of law. \\n\\uf0d8 Appeal to High Court within 180 days of receipt of Order \\nAn appeal shall be filed within a period of one hundred and eighty days \\nfrom the date on which the order appealed against is received by the \\naggrieved person and it shall be in such form, verified in such manner as \\nmay be prescribed: \\nProvided that the High Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of \\nthe said period if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not \\nfiling it within such period. \\nWhere the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is \\ninvolved in any case, it shall formulate that question and the appeal shall \\nbe heard only on the question so formulated, and the respondents shall, at \\nthe hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not \\ninvolve such question: \\nProvided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to take away or \\nabridge the power of the court to hear, for reasons to be recorded, the \\nappeal on any other substantial question of law not formulated by it, if it \\nis satisfied that the case involves such question. \\nThe High Court shall decide the question of law so formulated and \\ndeliver such judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such \\ndecision is founded and may award such cost as it deems fit. \\nThe High Court may determine any issue which–– \\n(a) has not been determined by the State Benches; or  \\n(b) has been wrongly determined by the State Bench or Area Benches, \\nby reason of a decision on such question of law as herein referred to \\nin sub-section (3). \\n\\uf0d8 Heard by a Bench of two judges of the High Court  \\nWhere an appeal has been filed before the High Court, it shall be heard \\nby a Bench of not less than two Judges of the High Court, and shall be \\ndecided in accordance with the opinion of such Judges or of the majority, \\nif any, of such Judges.',\n",

The phrase ‘any other purpose’ empowers High Courts to issue \\ndirection also in other judicial cases. The power of judicial review can be rightly \\nexercised by High Courts under Article 226. In this regard Article 226 has been \\nconferred wider scope than Article 32 of the constitution of India. This is basic \\nstructure of the constitution and settled principle. \\nExcept for a period when Article 226 was amended by the Constitution (42nd \\nAmendment) Act, 1976, the power relating to alternative remedy has been \\nconsidered to be a rule of self imposed limitation. It is essentially a rule of policy, \\nconvenience and discretion and never a rule of law. Despite the existence of an \\nalternative remedy it is within the jurisdiction of discretion of the High Courts to \\ngrant relief under Article 226 of the Constitution. Normally, the High Courts \\nshould not interfere if there is an adequate efficacious alternative remedy. If \\nsomebody approaches the High Court without availing alternative remedy \\nprovided the High Court should ensure that he has made out strong case or that \\nthere exist good grounds to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction.',\n",
              " '590 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 22 \\n18.4 Article 226 of the Constitution confers on all the High Court’s a very wide \\npower in the matter of issuing writs \\nConstitutional Benches in the case of K. S. Rashid and Sons v Income Tax \\nInvestigation Commission and Ors. AIR (1954) SC 207; Sangram Singh v \\nElection Tribunal, Kotah and Ors.

(P) Ltd. v Sate of Madras \\nAIR (1966) SC 1089, held that Article 226 of the Constitution confers on all the \\nHigh Courts a very wide power in the matter of issuing writs. However, the \\nremedy of writ is an absolutely discretionary remedy and the High Court has \\nalways the discretion to refuse to grant any writ if it is satisfied that the aggrieved \\nparty can have an adequate or suitable relief elsewhere. The court, in \\nextraordinary circumstances, may exercise the power if it comes to the \\nconclusion that there has been a breach of principles of natural justice or \\nprocedure required for decision has not been adopted. \\nThus, it can be said that despite an alternative remedy, the writ petition can \\nbe entertained in appropriate cases where there is violation of principles of \\nnatural justice, or procedure required for decision has not been adopted or there is \\nan allegation of infringement of fundamental rights or where the orders or \\nproceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the virus of an Act is challenged. \\n18.5 Article 226 is not meant to short circuit or circumvent statutory provisions \\nThe Apex Court decision in the case of Assistant Collector of Central Excise \\nv Dunlop India Ltd and Ors.

Kamachi Steels Ltd. v \\nCommissioner of Central Excise, Chennai, reported in 2015 (317) E.L.T. 444 \\n(Mad.), while admitting an writ petition held that after the case has already been \\nsettled by the Settlement Commission, the question of re-opening the same does \\nnot arise, unless and until it is established that fraud has been committed. \\n18.7 If impugned order has been passed on account of sheer non-application of \\nmind remanded for fresh hearing \\nThe High Court of Madras in an another case of M/s. Sujhan Instruments v \\nJoint Commissioner of Central Excise, Chennai, reported in 2015 (317) E.L.T. \\n446 (Mad), while admitting an writ petition held that impugned order has been \\npassed on account of sheer non-application of mind and based on irrelevant \\nconsideration, without reference to the orders passed by the superior authorities \\nand impugned order is vitiated with an error apparent on the face of record. Thus, \\nmatter is remanded for fresh hearing. \\n18.8 Thus, there is no absolute bar in entertaining a writ petition under \\nArticle 226 of Constitution of India despite existence of an alternative efficacious',\n",

Section 132 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (CGST Act, \\n2017) codifies the offences under the Act which warrant institution of criminal \\nproceedings and prosecution. Whoever commits any of the offences specified \\nunder sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of section 132 of the CGST Act, 2017, \\ncan be prosecuted. \\n3. Sanction of prosecution: \\n3.1 Sanction of prosecution has serious repercussions for the person \\ninvolved, therefore, the nature of evidence collected during the investigation \\nshould be carefully assessed. One of the important considerations for deciding \\nwhether prosecution should be launched is the availability of adequate evidence. \\nThe standard of proof required in a criminal prosecution is higher than \\nadjudication proceeding as the case has to be established beyond reasonable \\ndoubt. Therefore, even cases where demand is confirmed in adjudication \\nproceedings, evidence collected should be weighed so as to likely meet the above \\ncriteria for recommending prosecution. Decision should be taken on case-to-case \\nbasis considering various factors, such as, nature and gravity of offence, quantum \\nof tax evaded, or ITC wrongly availed, or refund wrongly taken and the nature as \\nwell as quality of evidence collected. \\n3.2. Prosecution should not be filed merely because a demand has been \\nconfirmed in the adjudication proceedings. Prosecution should not be launched in \\ncases of technical nature, or where additional claim of tax is based on a \\ndifference of opinion regarding interpretation of law. Further, the evidence \\ncollected should be adequate to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the person \\nhad guilty mind, knowledge of the offence, or had fraudulent intention or in any \\nmanner possessed mens-rea for committing the offence. It follows, therefore, that \\nin the case of public limited companies, prosecution should not be launched',\n",
              " '612 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 23 \\nindiscriminately against all the Directors of the company but should be restricted \\nto only persons who oversaw day-to-day operations of the company and have \\ntaken active part in committing the tax evasion etc. or had connived at it. \\n4. Decision on prosecution should normally be taken immediately on \\ncompletion of the adjudication proceedings, except in cases of arrest where \\nprosecution should be filed as early as possible. Hon’ble Supreme Court of India \\nin the case of Radheshyam Kejriwal [2011 (266) ELT 294 (SC)] has, inter-alia, \\nobserved the following: \\n(i) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings can be launched \\nsimultaneously;  \\n(ii) Decision in adjudication proceedings is not necessary before initiating \\ncriminal prosecution;  \\n(iii) Adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are independent in \\nnature to each other;  \\n(iv) The findings against the person facing prosecution in the adjudication \\nproceedings is not binding on the proceeding for criminal prosecution; \\n(v) The finding in the adjudication proceedings in favour of the person \\nfacing trial for identical violation will depend upon the nature of finding. \\nIf the exoneration in adjudication proceedings is on technical ground and \\nnot on merit, prosecution may continue; and  \\n(vi) In case of exoneration, however, on merits where the allegation is found \\nto be not sustainable at all and the person held innocent, criminal \\nprosecution on the same set of facts and circumstances cannot be allowed \\nto continue, the underlying principle being the higher standard of proof \\nin criminal cases. \\nIn view of the above observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court, \\nprosecution complaint may even be filed before adjudication of the case, \\nespecially where offence involved is grave, or qualitative evidences are \\navailable, or it is apprehended that the concerned person may delay \\ncompletion of adjudication proceedings. In cases where any offender is \\narrested under section 69 of the CGST Act, 2017, prosecution complaint \\nmay be filed even before issuance of the Show Cause Notice.  \\n5. Monetary limits: \\n5.1 Monetary Limit: Prosecution should normally be launched where amount \\nof tax evasion, or misuse of ITC, or fraudulently obtained refund in relation to \\noffences specified under sub-section (1) of section 132 of the CGST Act, 2017 is \\nmore than Five Hundred Lakh rupees. However, in following cases, the said \\nmonetary limit shall not be applicable: \\n \\n(i) Habitual evaders: Prosecution can be launched in the case of a \\ncompany/taxpayer habitually involved in tax evasion or misusing Input \\nTax Credit (ITC) facility or fraudulently obtained refund. A company/ \\ntaxpayer would be treated as habitual evader, if it has been involved in \\ntwo or more cases of confirmed demand (at the first adjudication level or',\n",

DIGIT database may be used to \\nidentify such habitual evaders. \\n \\n(ii) Arrest Cases: Cases where during the course of investigation, arrests \\nhave been made under section 69 of the CGST Act.  \\n6. Authority to sanction prosecution: \\n6.1 The prosecution complaint for prosecuting a person should be filed only \\nafter obtaining the sanction of the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner of CGST in \\nterms of sub-section (6) of section 132 of CGST Act, 2017. \\n6.2 In respect of cases investigated by DGGI, the prosecution complaint for \\nprosecuting a person should be filed only after obtaining the sanction of Pr. \\nAdditional Director General/Additional Director General, Directorate General of \\nGST Intelligence (DGGI) of the concerned zonal unit/Hqrs. \\n7. Procedure for sanction of prosecution: \\n7.1 In cases of arrest(s) made under section 69 of the CGST Act, 2017: \\n7.1.1 Where during the course of investigation, arrest(s) have been made and \\nno bail has been granted, all efforts should be made to file prosecution complaint \\nin the Court within sixty (60) days of arrest. In all other cases of arrest, \\nprosecution complaint should also be filed within a definite time frame. The \\nproposal of filing complaint in the format of investigation report prescribed in \\nAnnexure-I, should be forwarded to the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner, within \\nfifty (50) days of arrest. The Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner shall examine the \\nproposal and take decision as per section 132 of CGST Act, 2017. If prosecution \\nsanction is accorded, he shall issue a sanction order along with an order \\nauthorizing the investigating officer (at the level of Superintendent) of the case to \\nfile the prosecution complaint in the competent court. \\n7.1.2 In cases investigated by DGGI wherever an arrest has been made, \\nprocedure as detailed in para 7.1.1 should be followed by officers of equivalent \\nrank of DGGI. \\n7.1.3 The Additional/Joint Commissioner or Additional/Joint Director in the \\ncase of DGGI, must ensure that all the documents/evidence and list of witnesses \\nare kept ready before forwarding the proposal of filing complaint to Pr. \\nCommissioner/Commissioner or Pr. ADG/ADG of DGGI. \\n7.2 In case of filing of prosecution against legal person, including natural \\nperson: \\n7.2.1 Section 137 (1) of the Act provides that where an offence under this \\nAct has been committed by a company, every person who, at the time offence \\nwas committed was in charge of, and was responsible to, the company for the \\nconduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed \\nto be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and \\npunished accordingly. Section 137(2) of the Act provides that where an offence',\n",

Thus, in the case of Companies, both the legal person as well as \\nnatural person are liable for prosecution under section 132 of the CGST Act. \\nSimilarly, under sub-section (3) of section 137, the provisions have been made \\nfor partnership firm or a Limited Liability Partnership or a Hindu Undivided \\nFamily or a Trust. \\n7.2.2 Where it is deemed fit to launch prosecution before adjudication of the \\ncase, the Additional/Joint Commissioner or Additional/Joint Director, DGGI, as \\nthe case may be, supervising the investigation, shall record the reason for the \\nsame and forward the proposal to the sanctioning authority. The decision of the \\nsanctioning authority shall be informed to the concerned adjudicating authority \\nso that there is no need for him to examine the case again from the perspective of \\nprosecution. \\n7.2.3 In all cases (other than those mentioned at para 7.2.2 and arrests where \\nprosecution complaint has already been filed before adjudication), the \\nadjudicating authority should invariably indicate at the time of passing the order \\nitself whether it considers the case fit for prosecution, so that it can be further \\nprocessed and sent to the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner for obtaining his \\nsanction of prosecution. \\n7.2.4 In cases, where Show Cause Notice has been issued by DGGI, the \\nrecommendation of adjudicating authority for filing of prosecution shall be sent \\nto the Pr. Additional Director General/Additional Director General, DGGI of the \\nconcerned zonal unit/Hqrs.  \\n7.2.5 Where at the time of passing of adjudication order, no view has been \\ntaken on prosecution by the Adjudicating Authority, the adjudication branch shall \\nre-submit the file within 15 days from the date of issue of adjudication order to \\nthe Adjudicating Authority to take view on prosecution. \\n7.2.6 Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner or Pr. Additional Director General/ \\nAdditional Director General of DGGI may on his own motion also, taking into \\nconsideration inter alia, the seriousness of the offence, examine whether the case \\nis fit for sanction of prosecution irrespective of whether the adjudicating \\nauthority has recommended prosecution or not. \\n7.2.7 An investigation report for the purpose of launching prosecution should \\nbe carefully prepared in the format given in Annexure-I, within one month of the \\ndate of receipt of the adjudication order or receipt of recommendation of \\nAdjudicating Authority, as the case may be.

In case of \\ndelay in filing complaint beyond 60 days, the reason for the same shall be \\nbrought to the notice of the sanctioning authority i.e., Pr. Commissioner/ \\nCommissioner or Pr. Additional Director General/Additional Director General, \\nby the officer authorised for filing of the complaint. \\n7.2.9 In the cases investigated by DGGI, except for cases pertaining to \\nsingle/multiple \\ntaxpayer(s) \\nunder \\nCentral \\nTax \\nadministration \\nin \\none \\nCommissionerate where arrests have not been made and the prosecution is not \\nproposed prior to issuance of show cause notice, prosecution complaints shall be \\nfiled and followed up by DGGI. In other cases, the complaint shall be filed by the \\nofficer at level of Superintendent of the jurisdictional Commissionerate, \\nauthorized by Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner of CGST. However, in all cases \\ninvestigated by DGGI, the prosecution shall continue to be sanctioned by \\nappropriate officer of DGGI. \\n8. Appeal against Court order in case of inadequate punishment/acquittal: \\n8.1 The Prosecution Cell in the Commissionerate shall examine the judgment \\nof the Court and submit their recommendations to the Pr. Commissioner/ \\nCommissioner. Where Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner is of the view that the \\naccused person has been let off with lighter punishment than what is envisaged in \\nthe Act or has been acquitted despite the evidence being strong, filing of appeal \\nshould be considered against the order within the stipulated time. Before filing of \\nappeal in such cases, concurrence of Pr. CC/CC should be obtained. Sanction for \\nappeal in such cases shall, however, be accorded by Pr. Commissioner/ \\nCommissioner. \\n8.2 In respect of cases booked by DGGI, the Prosecution Cell in the \\nDirectorate shall examine the judgment of the court and submit their \\nrecommendations to the Pr. Additional Director General/Additional Director \\nGeneral who shall take a view regarding acceptance of the order or filing of \\nappeal. However, before filing of appeal, concurrence of DG or Pr. DG (for cases \\nbooked by HQ Unit) should be obtained. \\n9. Procedure for withdrawal of prosecution:  \\n9.1 Procedure for withdrawal of sanction-order of prosecution \\n9.1.1 In cases where prosecution has been sanctioned but complaint has not \\nbeen filed and new facts or evidence have come to light necessitating review of \\nthe sanction for prosecution, the Commissionerate should immediately bring the \\nsame to the notice of the sanctioning authority. After considering the new facts \\nand evidence, the sanctioning authority, if satisfied, may recommend to the',\n",
              " '616 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 23 \\njurisdictional Pr. Chief Commissioner/Chief Commissioner that the sanction for \\nprosecution be withdrawn who shall then take a decision.  \\n9.1.2 In the cases investigated by DGGI, such withdrawal of sanction order \\nmay be made with the approval of Director General of DGGI of concerned sub-\\nnational unit. In the cases booked by DGGI, Hqrs. Pr. Director General shall be \\ncompetent to approve the withdrawal of sanction order.  \\n9.2 Procedure for withdrawal of complaint already filed for prosecution \\n9.2.1 Attention is invited to judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court on the issue \\nof relation between adjudication proceedings and prosecution in the case of \\nRadheshyam Kejriwal, supra. Hon’ble Supreme Court in para 43 have observed \\nas below: “In our opinion, therefore, the yardstick would be to judge as to \\nwhether allegation in the adjudication proceeding as well as proceeding for \\nprosecution is identical and the exoneration of the person concerned in the \\nadjudication proceeding is on merits. In case it is found on merit that there is no \\ncontravention of the provisions of the Act in the adjudication proceeding, the trial \\nof the person concerned shall be in abuse of the process of the court.”  \\nThe said ratio is equally applicable to GST Law. Therefore, where it is found \\non merit that there is no contravention of the provisions of the Act in the \\nadjudication proceedings and such order has attained finality, Pr. Commissioner/ \\nCommissioner or Pr. Additional Director General/Additional Director General \\nafter taking approval of Pr. Chief Commissioner/Chief Commissioner or Pr. \\nDirector General/Director General, as the case may be, would ensure filing of an \\napplication through Public Prosecutor in the court to allow withdrawal of \\nprosecution in accordance with law. The withdrawal can only be affected with \\nthe approval of the court.  \\n10. General guidelines \\n10.1 It has been reported that delay in the Court proceedings is often due to \\nnon-availability of the records required to be produced before the Court or due to \\ndelay in drafting of the complaint, listing of the exhibits etc. It shall be the \\nresponsibility of the officer who has been authorized to file complaint, to take \\ncharge of all documents, statements and other exhibits that would be required to \\nbe produced before a Court. The list of exhibits etc. should be finalized in \\nconsultation with the Public Prosecutor at the time of drafting of the complaint. \\nNo time should be lost in ensuring that all exhibits are kept in safe custody. \\nWhere a complaint has not been filed even after a lapse of 60 days from the \\nreceipt of sanction for prosecution, the reason for delay shall be brought to the \\nnotice of the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner or the Pr. Additional Director \\nGeneral/Additional Director General of DGGI by the Additional/Joint \\nCommissioner in charge of the Commissionerate or Additional/Joint Director of \\nDGGI, responsible for filing of the complaint.  \\n10.2 Filing of prosecution need not be kept in abeyance on the ground that \\nthe taxpayer has gone in appeal/revision. However, to ensure that the proceeding \\nin appeal/revision are not unduly delayed because the case records are required \\nfor the purpose of prosecution, a parallel file containing copies of essential \\ndocuments relating to adjudication should be maintained.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 23 \\nOffences and Penalties \\n617 \\n10.3 The Superintendent in-charge of adjudication section should endorse \\ncopy of all adjudication orders to the prosecution section. The Superintendent in \\ncharge of prosecution section should monitor receipt of all serially numbered \\nadjudication orders and obtain copies of adjudication orders of missing serial \\nnumbers from the adjudication section every month. In respect of adjudication \\norders related to DGGI cases, Superintendent in charge of adjudication section \\nshould ensure endorsing a copy of adjudication order to DGGI. Concerned Zonal \\nUnits/Hqrs. of DGGI shall also follow up the status of adjudication of the case \\nfrom the concerned Commissionerate or adjudicating authority. \\n11. Publication of names of persons convicted: \\n11.1 Section 159 of the CGST Act, 2017 grants power to the Pr. \\nCommissioner/Commissioner or any other officer authorised by him on his \\nbehalf to publish name and other particulars of the person convicted under the \\nAct. It is directed that in deserving cases, the department should invoke this \\nsection in respect of all persons who are convicted under the Act.  \\n12. Monitoring of prosecution: \\n12.1 Prosecution, once launched, should be vigorously followed. The Pr. \\nCommissioner/Commissioner of CGST or Pr. Additional Director General/ \\nAdditional Director General of DGGI should monitor cases of prosecution at \\nmonthly intervals and take the corrective action wherever necessary to ensure \\nthat the progress of prosecution is satisfactory. In DGGI, an Additional/Joint \\nDirector in each zonal unit and DGGI (Hqrs) shall supervise the prosecution \\nrelated work and take stock of the pending prosecution cases. For keeping a track \\nof prosecution cases, entries of all prosecution cases should promptly be made in \\nDIGIT/Investigation Module, within 48 hours of sanction of prosecution and the \\nentries must be updated from time to time. Additional/Joint Commissioner or \\nAdditional/Joint Director, in-charge of supervising prosecution cases shall ensure \\nmaking timely entries in the database. \\n13. Compounding of offence \\n13.1 Section 138 of the CGST Act, 2017 provides for compounding of \\noffences by the Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner on payment of compounding \\namount. The provisions regarding compounding of offence should be brought to \\nthe notice of person being prosecuted and such person be given an offer of \\ncompounding by Pr. Commissioner/Commissioner or Pr. Additional Director \\nGeneral/Additional Director General of DGGI, as the case may be. \\n14. Transitional Provisions \\n14.1 All cases where sanction for prosecution is accorded after the issue of \\nthese instructions shall be dealt in accordance with the provisions of these \\ninstructions irrespective of the date of the offence. Cases where prosecution has \\nbeen sanctioned but no complaint has been filed before the magistrate shall also \\nbe reviewed by the prosecution sanctioning authority considering the provisions \\nof these instructions.',\n",

Inspection of prosecution work by the Directorate General of \\nPerformance Management \\n15.1 Director General, Directorate General of Performance Management and \\nPr. Chief Commissioners/Chief Commissioners, who are required to inspect the \\nCommissionerate, should specifically check whether instructions in this regard \\nare being followed scrupulously and make a mention of the implementation of \\nthe guidelines in their inspection report apart from recording of statistical data. \\nSimilarly exercise should also be carried out in DGGI. \\n16. Where a case is considered suitable for launching prosecution and where \\nadequate evidence is forthcoming, securing conviction largely depends on the \\nquality of investigation. It is, therefore, necessary for senior officers to take \\npersonal interest in the investigation of important cases of GST evasion and in \\nrespect of cases having money laundering angle and to provide guidance and \\nsupport to the investigating officers. \\n17. To ensure proper training to the officers posted for prosecution work, the \\nPr. Director General, National Academy of Customs, Indirect Taxes and \\nNarcotics (NACIN), Faridabad, should organized separate training courses on \\nprosecution/arrests etc, from time to time and should incorporate a series of \\nlectures on this issue in the courses organized for investigation. The Pr. \\nCommissioner/Commissioner or Pr. ADG/ADG of DGGI should judiciously \\nsponsor officers for such courses. \\n******* \\nBudget proposal -2024 for new penalty provision \\nA special procedure for manufacturers of tobacco products was notified in \\nNotification 04/2024-CT dated 05-01.2024 which is made with effect from 1st \\nApril 2024. In this regard a new section is proposed to be included for imposing \\npenalty on contravention of such notified procedure. \\nThe new section propses to impose penalty of `1 lakh per machine (packing \\nmachines used for filling and packing of packages) which are not registered as \\nper the special procedure. \\nIn addition to this penalty, such machines would also be liable for seizure \\nand confiscation, subject to the condition that the imposed penalty is paid and the \\nsaid machine gets registered within 3 days from the communication of the order \\nof penalty. \\n******* \\n22. Case Law \\nRelease of goods on payment of fine permissible even during pendency of \\nconfiscation proceedings: \\nThe Bombay High Court has held that the intent of Section 130(2) of the \\nCGST Act, 2017 is to provide an option to the owner to redeem the goods before \\nhe is divested of his ownership and while the process of adjudication is going on. \\nThe Court in this regard dissected the said section using the present continuous \\nwords ‘officer adjudicating it’ and the words ‘owner of the goods’, while',\n",
              " 'Chap. 23 \\nOffences and Penalties \\n619 \\ncomparing it with sub-section 130(7) which used the words ’confiscated goods’. \\nAccording to the Court, incorporation of Section 130(2) over and apart from \\nSection 130(7) was an indication that even before the owner is divested of his \\nownership, he must have an option to pay fine in lieu of confiscation. It also \\nobserved that absence of the use of the words ‘provisional release’ or non-\\nreference to Section 67(6) was not determinative of the intent of the section. \\nThe High Court held that to obtain the release of the goods or conveyances, \\nwhile the adjudication proceedings are continuing, the taxpayer needs to pay only \\nthe fine and not the tax, penalty and charges thereon. Observing that the words \\n‘be liable’ in Section 130(3) only conveys a possibility of attracting the \\nobligation and not an imperative obligation, shorn of fair procedure, the Court \\nwas of the view that the tax, penalty and charges are to be paid after adjudication. \\nDismissing the review petition filed by the Revenue department, the court also \\nheld that fine in lieu of confiscation needs to be calculated only based on market \\nvalue as defined under Section 2(73) and not on the maximum retail price.

Introduction  \\nAnti-profiteering measures are globally accepted policy implemented by the \\nvarious countries for combating temporary inflationary prices of goods and \\nservices during transitional phase of switch over to new tax regime. On learning \\nthe experiences from the Global economy on anti-profiteering measures, the \\nNational Anti-profiteering Authority has been constituted by the Central \\nGovernment to control rise in prices of goods and services after implementation \\nof new tax regime (GST) in the country.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 24 \\nAnti-Profiteering Measures \\n621 \\nThe very objective of anti-profiteering measures is to provide benefit of GST \\nto the consumers in terms of reduced prices and not allow more profit margins to \\nthe businessmen in the cost of rise in prices of goods and services resulting \\ninflation in the country.  \\n2. Provisions of Anti-Profiteering measures  \\nSection 171 of CGST Act, 2017 has prescribed the provisions of Anti-\\nprofiteering measure. The relevant portion of Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \\nis reproduced as under: \\n“171. Anti-profiteering Measure.—(1) Any reduction in rate of tax on \\nany supply of goods or services or the benefit of input tax credit shall be \\npassed on to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices.  \\n(2) The Central Government may, on recommendation of the Council, by \\nnotification, constitute an Authority, or empower an existing Authority \\nconstituted under any law for the time being in force, to examine whether \\ninput tax credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in the tax \\nrate have actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the price of the \\nsaid goods or services or both supplied by him. \\n(3) The Authority referred to in sub-section (2) shall exercise such \\npowers and discharge such functions as may be prescribed.” \\nThe Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019 - After sub-section 3, inserted 3A. \\n(3A) Where the Authority referred to in sub-section 2, after holding \\nexamination as required under the said sub-section comes to the conclusion \\nthat any registered person has profiteered under sub-section (1), such person \\nshall be liable to pay penalty equivalent to 10% of the amount so profiteered: \\nProvided that no penalty shall be leviable if the profiteered amount is \\ndeposited within thirty days of the date of passing of the order by the \\nAuthority. \\nExplanation.—For the purposes of this section, the expression \\n“profiteered” shall mean the amount determined on account of not passing \\nthe benefit of reduction in rate of tax on supply of goods or services or both \\nor the benefit of input tax credit to the recipient by way of commensurate \\nreduction in the price of the goods or services or both.\" \\nThus, it is crystal clear from the above CGST Act provision that anti-\\nprofiteering authority has to keep watch on business or to examine whether input \\ntax credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in the tax rate have \\nactually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the price of the goods or \\nservices or both supplied by him, this is to ensure that the consumer is protected \\nfrom arbitrary price increase in the name of GST.

The respondent passed on the benefit at the \\naggregate level of the SKU or at the product level where it was required to pass \\nsuch benefit on every SKU so that the benefit could reach every buyer of that \\nSKU. Hence, the methodology adopted by the respondent to pass on the benefit \\nof rate reduction was incorrect. Therefore, the total profit made by the respondent \\nwas determined at around `89 crores.

The registered person on whose \\ngoods (inputs or capital goods) job work is performed is called the \\n“Principal” for the purposes of section 143 of the CGST Act. The said \\nsection which encapsulates the provisions related to job work, provides \\nthat the registered principal may, without payment of tax, send inputs or \\ncapital goods to a job worker for job work and, if required, from there \\nsubsequently to another job worker and so on. Subsequently, on \\ncompletion of the job work (by the last job worker), the principal shall \\neither bring back the goods to his place of business or supply (including \\nexport) the same directly from the place of business/premises of the job \\nworker within the time specified under section 143. \\n\\uf0d8 Amended Para 3. It may be noted that the responsibility of keeping \\nproper accounts of the inputs and capital goods sent for job work lies \\nwith the principal. Moreover, if the time frame specified under section \\n143 for bringing back or further supplying the inputs/capital goods is not \\nadhered to, the activity of sending the goods for job work shall be \\ndeemed to be a supply by the principal on the day when the said \\ninputs/capital goods were sent out by him. Thus, essentially, sending \\ngoods for job work is not a supply as such, but it acquires the character \\nof supply only when the inputs/capital goods sent for job work are \\nneither received back by the principal nor supplied further by the \\nprincipal from the place of business/premises of the job worker within \\nthe specified time period (under section 143) of being sent out. It may be \\nnoted that the responsibility for sending the goods for job work as well as \\nbringing them back or supplying them has been cast on the principal. \\n\\uf0d8 Amended Para 6.1 Doubts have been raised about the requirement of \\nobtaining registration by job workers when they are located in the same \\nState where the principal is located or when they are located in a State \\ndifferent from that of the principal. It may be noted that the job worker is \\nrequired to obtain registration only if his aggregate turnover, to be \\ncomputed on all India basis, in a financial year exceeds the specified \\nthreshold limit as specified in sub-section (1) of section 22 of the said \\nAct, read with clause (iii) of the Explanation to the said section in case \\nboth the principal and the job worker are located in the same State.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 25 \\nJob Work under GST \\n639 \\nWhere the principal and the job worker are located in different States, the \\nrequirement for registration flows from clause (i) of section 24 of the \\nCGST Act which provides for compulsory registration of suppliers \\nmaking any inter-State supply of services. However, exemption from \\nregistration has been granted in case the aggregate turnover of the inter-\\nState supply of taxable services does not exceed the specified threshold \\nlimit as specified in sub-section (1) of section 22 of the said Act, read \\nwith clause (iii) of the Explanation to the said section in a financial year \\nvide Notification No. 10/2017-Integrated Tax dated 13.10.2017 as \\namended vide Notification No. 3/2019-Integrated Tax, dated 29.01.19. \\nTherefore, it is clarified that a job worker is required to obtain \\nregistration only in cases where his aggregate turnover, to be computed \\non all India basis, in a financial year exceeds the threshold limit \\nregardless of whether the principal and the job worker are located in the \\nsame State or in different States. \\n\\uf0d8 Amended Para: 9.4.(i) Supply of job work services: The job worker, as a \\nsupplier of services, is liable to pay GST if he is liable to be registered. \\nHe shall issue an invoice at the time of supply of the services as \\ndetermined in terms of section 13 read with section 31 of the CGST Act. \\nThe value of services would be determined in terms of section 15 of the \\nCGST Act and would include not only the service charges but also the \\nvalue of any goods or services used by him for supplying the job work \\nservices, if recovered from the principal. Doubts have been raised \\nwhether the value of moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures or tools which \\nhave been provided by the principal to the job worker and have been \\nused by the latter for providing job work services would be included in \\nthe value of job work services. In this regard, attention is invited to \\nsection 15 of the CGST Act which lays down the principles for \\ndetermining the value of any supply under GST. Importantly, clause (b) \\nof sub-section (2) of section 15 of the CGST Act provides that any \\namount that the supplier is liable to pay in relation to the supply but \\nwhich has been incurred by the recipient will form part of the valuation \\nfor that particular supply, provided it has not been included in the price \\nfor such supply. Accordingly, it is clarified that the value of such moulds \\nand dies, jigs and fixtures or tools may not be included in the value of job \\nwork services provided its value has been factored in the price for the \\nsupply of such services by the job worker. \\n\\uf0d8 Amended Para 9.6 Thus, if the inputs or capital goods are neither \\nreturned nor supplied from the job worker’s place of business/premises \\nwithin the specified time period, the principal would issue an invoice for \\nthe same and declare such supplies in his return for that particular month \\nin which the time period of one year/three years has expired. The date of \\nsupply shall be the date on which such inputs or capital goods were \\ninitially sent to the job worker and interest for the intervening period \\nshall also be payable on the tax. If such goods are returned by the job',\n",

Further, there is no requirement of either returning back or \\nsupplying the goods from the job worker’s place of business/premises as \\nfar as moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures, or tools are concerned. \\nC.B.I & C, Circular No. 38/12/2018, dated 26-3-2018. \\nClarification on issues related to Job Work \\nVarious representations have been received regarding the procedures to be \\nfollowed for sending goods for job work and the related compliance requirements \\nfor the principal and the job worker. In view of the difficulties being faced by the \\ntaxpayers and to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the \\nlaw across the field formations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred \\nunder section 168(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, \\n(hereinafter referred to as the “CGST Act”) hereby clarifies the various issues \\nraised as below:  \\n2. As per clause (68) of section 2 of the CGST Act, 2017, “job work” means \\nany treatment or process undertaken by a person on goods belonging to another \\nregistered person and the expression “job worker” shall be construed \\naccordingly. The registered person on whose goods (inputs or capital goods) job \\nwork is performed is called the “Principal” for the purposes of section 143 of the \\nCGST Act. The said section which encapsulates the provisions related to job \\nwork, provides that the registered principal may, without payment of tax, send \\ninputs or capital goods to a job worker for job work and, if required, from there \\nsubsequently to another job worker and so on. Subsequently, on completion of \\nthe job work (by the last job worker), the principal shall either bring back the \\ngoods to his place of business or supply (including export) the same directly from \\nthe place of business/premises of the job worker within one year in case of inputs \\nor within three years in case of capital goods (except moulds and dies, jigs and \\nfixtures or tools).  \\n3. It may be noted that the responsibility of keeping proper accounts of the \\ninputs and capital goods sent for job work lies with the principal. Moreover, if \\nthe time frame of one year/three years for bringing back or further supplying the \\ninputs/capital goods is not adhered to, the activity of sending the goods for job \\nwork shall be deemed to be a supply by the principal on the day when the said \\ninputs/capital goods were sent out by him. Thus, essentially, sending goods for \\njob work is not a supply as such, but it acquires the character of supply only \\nwhen the inputs/capital goods sent for job work are neither received back by the \\nprincipal nor supplied further by the principal from the place of business/ \\npremises of the job worker within one/three years of being sent out. It may be \\nnoted that the responsibility for sending the goods for job work as well as \\nbringing them back or supplying them has been cast on the principal.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 25 \\nJob Work under GST \\n641 \\n4. With respect to the above legal requirements, various issues have been \\nraised on the following aspects:  \\n(a) Scope/ambit of job work;  \\n(b) Requirement of registration for a principal/job worker;  \\n(c) Supply of goods by the principal from the job worker’s place of business/ \\npremises;  \\n(d) Movement of goods from the principal to the job worker and the \\ndocuments and intimation required therefore.  \\n(e) Liability to issue invoice, determination of place of supply and payment \\nof GST; and  \\n(f) Availability of input tax credit to the principal and the job worker.  \\n5. Scope/ambit of job work: Doubts have been raised on the scope of job \\nwork and whether any inputs, other than the goods provided by the principal, can \\nbe used by the job worker for providing the services of job 3 work. It may be \\nnoted that the definition of job work, as contained in clause (68) of section 2 of \\nthe CGST Act, entails that the job work is a treatment or process undertaken by a \\nperson on goods belonging to another registered person. Thus, the job worker is \\nexpected to work on the goods sent by the principal and whether the activity is \\ncovered within the scope of job work or not would have to be determined on the \\nbasis of facts and circumstances of each case. Further, it is clarified that the job \\nworker, in addition to the goods received from the principal, can use his own \\ngoods for providing the services of job work.  \\n6. Requirement of registration for the principal/job worker: It is \\nimportant to note that the provisions of section 143 of the CGST Act are \\napplicable to a registered person. Thus, it is only a registered person who can \\nsend the goods for job work under the said provisions. It may also be noted that \\nthe registered person (principal) is not obligated to follow the said provisions. It \\nis his choice whether or not to avail of the benefit of these special provisions.  \\n6.1 Doubts have been raised about the requirement of obtaining registration \\nby job workers when they are located in the same State where the principal is \\nlocated or when they are located in a State different from that of the principal. It \\nmay be noted that the job worker is required to obtain registration only if his \\naggregate turnover, to be computed on all India basis, in a financial year exceeds \\nthe specified threshold limit (i.e. `20 lakhs or `10 lakhs in case of special \\ncategory States except Jammu & Kashmir) in case both the principal and the job \\nworker are located in the same State. Where the principal and the job worker are \\nlocated in different States, the requirement for registration flows from clause (i) \\nof section 24 of the CGST Act which provides for compulsory registration of \\nsuppliers making any inter-State supply of services. However, exemption from \\nregistration has been granted in case the aggregate turnover of the inter State \\nsupply of taxable services does not exceed ` 20 lakhs or ` 10 lakhs in case of \\nspecial category States except Jammu & Kashmir in a financial year vide \\nNotification No. 10/2017-Integrated Tax dated 13.10.2017. Therefore, it is',\n",
              " '642 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 25 \\nclarified that a job worker is required to obtain registration only in cases where \\nhis aggregate turnover, to be computed on all India basis, in a financial year \\nexceeds the threshold limit regardless of whether the principal and the job worker \\nare located in the same State or in different States.  \\n7. Supply of goods by the principal from job worker’s place of business/ \\npremises: Doubts have been raised as to whether the principal can supply goods \\ndirectly from the job worker’s place of business/premises to its end customer and \\nif yes, whether the supply will be regarded as having been made by the principal \\nor by the job worker. It is clarified that the supply of goods by the principal from \\nthe place of business/premises of the job worker will be regarded as supply by \\nthe principal and not by the job worker as specified in section 143(1)(a) of the \\nCGST Act.  \\n8. Movement of goods from the principal to the job worker and the \\ndocuments and intimation required there for:  \\n8.1 Issues: Doubts have been raised about the documents required to be \\nissued for sending the goods (i) by the principal to the job worker, (ii) from one \\njob worker to another job worker; and (iii) from the job worker back to the \\nprincipal.  \\n8.2 Legal provisions: Section 143 of the CGST Act provides that the \\nprincipal may send and/or bring back inputs/capital goods for job work without \\npayment of tax, under intimation to the proper officer and subject to the \\nprescribed conditions. Rule 45 of the CGST Rules provides that the inputs, semi-\\nfinished goods or capital goods being sent for job work (including that being sent \\nfrom one job worker to another job worker for further job work or those being \\nsent directly to a job worker) shall be sent under the cover of a challan issued by \\nthe principal, containing the details specified in rule 55 of the CGST Rules. This \\nrule has been amended vide Notification No. 14/2018-Central tax dated \\n23.03.2018 to provide that a job worker may endorse the challan issued by the \\nprincipal. The principal is also required to file FORM GST ITC-04 every quarter \\nstating the said details. Further, as per the provisions contained in rule 138 of the \\nCGST Rules, an e-way bill is required to be generated by every registered person \\nwho causes movement of goods of consignment value exceeding fifty thousand \\nrupees even in cases where such movement is for reasons other than for supply \\n(e.g. in case of movement for job work). Further, the third proviso to rule 138(1) \\nof the CGST Rules provides that the e-way bill shall be generated either by the \\nprincipal or by the registered job worker irrespective of the value of the \\nconsignment, where goods are sent by a principal located in one State/Union \\nterritory to a job worker located in any other State/Union territory.  \\n8.3 As mentioned above, rule 45 of the CGST Rules provides that inputs, \\nsemi-finished goods or capital goods shall be sent to the job worker under the \\ncover of a challan issued by the principal, including in cases where such goods \\nare sent directly to a job worker. Further, rule 55 of the CGST Rules provides \\nthat the consignor may issue a delivery challan containing the prescribed \\nparticulars in case of transportation of goods for job work. It may be noted that',\n",
              " 'Chap. 25 \\nJob Work under GST \\n643 \\nrule 45 provides for the issuance of a challan by the principal whereas rule 55 \\nprovides that the consignor may issue the delivery challan. It is also important to \\nnote that as per the provisions contained in rule 138 of the CGST Rules, an e-way \\nbill is required to be generated by every registered person who causes movement \\nof goods of consignment value exceeding fifty thousand rupees even in cases \\nwhere such movement is for reasons other than for supply (e.g. in case of \\nmovement for job work). The third proviso to rule 138(1) of the CGST Rules \\nprovides that the e-way bill shall be generated either by the principal or by the \\nregistered job worker irrespective of the value of the consignment, where goods \\nare sent by a principal located in one State/Union territory to a job worker located \\nin any other State/Union territory. It may also be noted that as per Explanation 1 \\nto rule 138(3) of the CGST Rules, where the goods are supplied by an \\nunregistered supplier to a registered recipient, the movement shall be said to be \\ncaused by such recipient if the recipient is known at the time of commencement \\nof the movement of goods. In other words, the e-way bill shall be generated by \\nthe principal, wherever required, in case the job worker is unregistered.  \\n8.4 Clarification: On conjoint reading of the relevant legal provisions, the \\nfollowing is clarified with respect to the issuance of challan, furnishing of \\nintimation and other documentary requirements in this regard:  \\n \\n(i)  Where goods are sent by principal to only one job worker: The principal \\nshall prepare in triplicate, the challan in terms of rules 45 and 55 of the \\nCGST Rules, for sending the goods to a job worker. Two copies of the \\nchallan may be sent to the job worker along with the goods. The job \\nworker should send one copy of the said challan along with the goods, \\nwhile returning them to the principal. The FORM GST ITC-04 will serve \\nas the intimation as envisaged under section 143 of the CGST Act, 2017.  \\n \\n(ii)  Where goods are sent from one job worker to another job worker: In \\nsuch cases, the goods may move under the cover of a challan issued \\neither by the principal or the job worker. In the alternative, the challan \\nissued by the principal may be endorsed by the job worker sending the \\ngoods to another job worker, indicating there in the quantity and \\ndescription of goods being sent. The same process may be repeated for \\nsubsequent movement of the goods to other job workers.  \\n (iii) Where the goods are returned to the principal by the job worker: The job \\nworker should send one copy of the challan received by him from the \\nprincipal while returning the goods to the principal after carrying out the \\njob work.  \\n (iv)  Where the goods are sent directly by the supplier to the job worker: In \\nthis case, the goods may move from the place of business of the supplier \\nto the place of business/premises of the job worker with a copy of the \\ninvoice issued by the supplier in the name of the buyer (i.e. the principal) \\nwherein the job worker’s name and address should also be mentioned as \\nthe consignee, in terms of rule 46(o) of the CGST Rules. The buyer (i.e., \\nthe principal) shall issue the challan under rule 45 of the CGST Rules',\n",
              " '644 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 25 \\nand send the same to the job worker directly in terms of para (i) above. In \\ncase of import of goods by the principal which are then supplied directly \\nfrom the customs station of import, the goods may move from the \\ncustoms station of import to the place of business/premises of the job \\nworker with a copy of the Bill of Entry and the principal shall issue the \\nchallan under rule 45 of the CGST Rules and send the same to the job \\nworker directly.  \\n \\n(v) Where goods are returned in piecemeal by the job worker: In case the \\ngoods after carrying out the job work, are sent in piecemeal quantities by \\na job worker to another job worker or to the principal, the challan issued \\noriginally by the principal cannot be endorsed and a fresh challan is \\nrequired to be issued by the job worker.  \\n (vi)  Submission of intimation: Rule 45(3) of the CGST Rules provides that \\nthe principal is required to furnish the details of challans in respect of \\ngoods sent to a job worker or received from a job worker or sent from \\none job worker to another job worker during a quarter in FORM GST \\nITC-04 by the 25th day of the month succeeding the quarter or within \\nsuch period as may be extended by the Commissioner. It is clarified that \\nit is the responsibility of the principal to include the details of all the \\nchallans relating to goods sent by him to one or more job worker or from \\none job worker to another and its return therefrom. The FORM GST \\nITC-04 will serve as the intimation as envisaged under section 143 of the \\nCGST Act.  \\n9. Liability to issue invoice, determination of place of supply and payment of \\nGST:  \\n9.1 Issues: Doubts have been raised about the time, value and place of \\nsupply in the hands of principal or job worker as also about the issuance of \\ninvoices by the principal or job worker, as the case may be, with regard to the \\nsupply of goods from principal to the recipient from the job worker’s place of \\nbusiness/premises and the supply of services by the job worker.  \\n9.2 Legal provisions: As mentioned earlier, section 143 of the CGST Act \\nprovides that the inputs/capital goods may be sent for job work without payment \\nof tax and unless they are brought back by the principal, or supplied from the \\nplace of business/premises of the job worker within a period of one/three years, \\nas the case may be, it would be deemed that such inputs or capital goods (other \\nthan moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures or tools) have been supplied by the \\nprincipal to the job worker on the day when the said inputs or capital goods were \\nsent out. Further, the job worker is liable to pay GST on the supply of job work \\nservices.  \\n9.3 The provisions relating to time of supply are contained in sections 12 and \\n13 of the CGST Act and that for determining the value of supply are in section 15 \\nof the CGST Act. The provisions relating to place of supply are contained in \\nsection 10 of the IGST Act, 2017. Further, the provisions relating to the issuance',\n",
              " 'Chap. 25 \\nJob Work under GST \\n645 \\nof an invoice are contained in section 31 of the CGST Act read with rule 46 of \\nthe CGST Rules.  \\n9.4 On conjoint reading of all the provisions, the following is clarified with \\nrespect to the issuance of an invoice, time of supply and value of supply:  \\n \\n(i)  Supply of job work services: The job worker, as a supplier of services, \\nis liable to pay GST if he is liable to be registered. He shall issue an \\ninvoice at the time of supply of the services as determined in terms of \\nsection 13 read with section 31 of the CGST Act. The value of services \\nwould be determined in terms of section 15 of the CGST Act and would \\ninclude not only the service charges but also the value of any goods or \\nservices used by him for supplying the job work services, if recovered \\nfrom the principal. Doubts have been raised whether the value of moulds \\nand dies, jigs and fixtures or tools which have been provided by the \\nprincipal to the job worker and have been used by the latter for providing \\njob work services would be included in the value of job work services. In \\nthis regard, attention is invited to section 15 of the CGST Act which lays \\ndown the principles for determining the value of any supply under GST. \\nImportantly, clause (b) of sub-section (2) of section 15 of the CGST Act \\nprovides that any amount that the supplier is liable to pay in relation to \\nthe supply but which has been incurred by the recipient will form part of \\nthe valuation for that particular supply, provided it has not been included \\nin the price for such supply. Accordingly, it is clarified that the value of \\nsuch moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures or tools may not be included in \\nthe value of job work services provided its value has been factored in the \\nprice for the supply of such services by the job worker. It may be noted \\nthat if the job worker is not registered, GST would be payable by the \\nprincipal on reverse charge basis in terms of the provisions contained in \\nsection 9(4) of the CGST Act. However, the said provision has been kept \\nin abeyance for the time being.  \\n \\n(ii)  Supply of goods by the principal from the place of business/premises \\nof job worker: Section 143 of the CGST Act provides that the principal \\nmay supply, from the place of business/premises of a job worker, inputs \\nafter completion of job work or otherwise or capital goods (other than \\nmoulds and dies, jigs and fixtures or tools) within one year or three years \\nrespectively of their being sent out, on payment of tax within India, or \\nwith or without payment of tax for exports, as the case may be. This \\nfacility is available to the principal only if he declares the job worker’s \\nplace of business/premises as his additional place of business or if the job \\nworker is registered. Since the supply is being made by the principal, it is \\nclarified that the time, value and place of supply would have to be \\ndetermined in the hands of the principal irrespective of the location of the \\njob worker’s place of business/premises. Further, the invoice would have \\nto be issued by the principal. It is also clarified that in case of exports \\ndirectly from the job worker’s place of business/premises, the LUT or',\n",

In case the supply is made from the job worker’s \\nplace of business/premises, the invoice will be issued by the supplier \\n(principal) located in State A to the recipient located in State C. The said \\ntransaction will be an inter-State supply. In case the recipient is also \\nlocated in State A, it will be an intra-State supply.  \\n (iii)  Supply of waste and scrap generated during the job work: sub - \\nsection (5) of Section 143 of the CGST Act provides that the waste and \\nscrap generated during the job work may be supplied by the registered \\njob worker directly from his place of business or by the principal in case \\nthe job worker is not registered. The principles enunciated in para (ii) \\nabove would apply mutatis mutandis in this case.  \\n9.5 Violation of conditions laid down in section 143: As per the provisions \\ncontained in section 143 of the CGST Act, if the inputs or capital goods (other \\nthan moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures or tools) are neither received back by the \\nprincipal nor supplied from the job worker’s place of business within the \\nspecified time period, the inputs or capital goods (other than moulds and dies, \\njigs and fixtures or tools) would be deemed to have been supplied by the \\nprincipal to the job worker on the day when such inputs or capital goods were \\nsent out to the first job worker.  \\n9.6 Thus, if the inputs or capital goods are neither returned nor supplied from \\nthe job worker’s place of business/premises within the specified time period, the \\nprincipal would issue an invoice for the same and declare such supplies in his \\nreturn for that particular month in which the time period of one year/three years \\nhas expired. The date of supply shall be the date on which such inputs or capital \\ngoods were initially sent to the job worker and interest for the intervening period \\nshall also be payable on the tax. If such goods are returned by the job worker \\nafter the stipulated time period, the same would be treated as a supply by the job \\nworker to the principal and the job worker would be liable to pay GST if he is \\nliable for registration in accordance with the provisions contained in the CGST \\nAct read with the rules made thereunder. It may be noted that if the job worker is \\nnot registered, GST would be payable by the principal on reverse charge basis in \\nterms of the provisions contained in section 9(4) of the CGST Act. However, the \\nsaid provision has been kept in abeyance for the time being. Further, there is no \\nrequirement of either returning back or supplying the goods from the job \\nworker’s place of business/premises as far as moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures, \\nor tools are concerned.  \\n10. Availability of input tax credit to the principal and job worker: \\nDoubts have been raised regarding the availability of input tax credit (ITC) to the \\nprincipal in respect of inputs/capital goods that are directly received by the job \\nworker. Doubts have also been raised whether the job worker is eligible for ITC \\nin respect of inputs, etc. used by him in supplying job work services. It is \\nclarified that, in view of the provisions contained in clause (b) of sub-section (2)',\n",
              " 'Chap. 25 \\nJob Work under GST \\n647 \\nof section 16 of the CGST Act, the input tax credit would be available to the \\nprincipal, irrespective of the fact whether the inputs or capital goods are received \\nby the principal and then sent to the job worker for processing, etc. or whether \\nthey are directly received at the job worker’s place of business/premises, without \\nbeing brought to the premises of the principal. It is also clarified that the job \\nworker is also eligible to avail ITC on inputs, etc. used by him in supplying the \\njob work services if he is registered.  \\n* \\n* \\n* \\nJob worker clarification: \\nCircular No. 38/12/2018 dated 26.03.2018 has been revised in view of the \\namendment carried out in section 143 of the CGST Act, 2017 vide section 29 of \\nthe CGST (Amendment) Act, 2018 revised vide CBIC, Circular No. 88/07/2019-\\nGST dated 1st February 2019, has clarified the following with regard to Job \\nworker, summarized as under:—  \\n\\uf0d8 Amended Para 2 - As per clause (68) of section 2 of the CGST Act, \\n2017, “job work” means any treatment or process undertaken by a person \\non goods belonging to another registered person and the expression “job \\nworker” shall be construed accordingly. The registered person on whose \\ngoods (inputs or capital goods) job work is performed is called the \\n“Principal” for the purposes of section 143 of the CGST Act. The said \\nsection which encapsulates the provisions related to job work, provides \\nthat the registered principal may, without payment of tax, send inputs or \\ncapital goods to a job worker for job work and, if required, from there \\nsubsequently to another job worker and so on. Subsequently, on \\ncompletion of the job work (by the last job worker), the principal shall \\neither bring back the goods to his place of business or supply (including \\nexport) the same directly from the place of business/premises of the job \\nworker within the time specified under section 143. \\n\\uf0d8 Amended Para 3. It may be noted that the responsibility of keeping \\nproper accounts of the inputs and capital goods sent for job work lies \\nwith the principal. Moreover, if the time frame specified under section \\n143 for bringing back or further supplying the inputs/capital goods is not \\nadhered to, the activity of sending the goods for job work shall be \\ndeemed to be a supply by the principal on the day when the said \\ninputs/capital goods were sent out by him. Thus, essentially, sending \\ngoods for job work is not a supply as such, but it acquires the character \\nof supply only when the inputs/capital goods sent for job work are \\nneither received back by the principal nor supplied further by the \\nprincipal from the place of business/premises of the job worker within \\nthe specified time period (under section 143) of being sent out. It may be \\nnoted that the responsibility for sending the goods for job work as well as \\nbringing them back or supplying them has been cast on the principal. \\n\\uf0d8 Amended Para 6.1 Doubts have been raised about the requirement of \\nobtaining registration by job workers when they are located in the same',\n",

It may be noted that the job worker is \\nrequired to obtain registration only if his aggregate turnover, to be \\ncomputed on all India basis, in a financial year exceeds the specified \\nthreshold limit as specified in sub-section (1) of section 22 of the said \\nAct, read with clause (iii) of the Explanation to the said section in case \\nboth the principal and the job worker are located in the same State. \\nWhere the principal and the job worker are located in different States, the \\nrequirement for registration flows from clause (i) of section 24 of the \\nCGST Act which provides for compulsory registration of suppliers \\nmaking any inter-State supply of services. However, exemption from \\nregistration has been granted in case the aggregate turnover of the inter-\\nState supply of taxable services does not exceed the specified threshold \\nlimit as specified in sub-section (1) of section 22 of the said Act, read \\nwith clause (iii) of the Explanation to the said section in a financial year \\nvide Notification No. 10/2017-Integrated Tax dated 13.10.2017 as \\namended vide Notification No 3/2019-Integrated Tax, dated 29.01.19. \\nTherefore, it is clarified that a job worker is required to obtain \\nregistration only in cases where his aggregate turnover, to be computed \\non all India basis, in a financial year exceeds the threshold limit \\nregardless of whether the principal and the job worker are located in the \\nsame State or in different States. \\n\\uf0d8 Amended Para: 9.4. (i) Supply of job work services: The job worker, as a \\nsupplier of services, is liable to pay GST if he is liable to be registered. \\nHe shall issue an invoice at the time of supply of the services as \\ndetermined in terms of section 13 read with section 31 of the CGST Act. \\nThe value of services would be determined in terms of section 15 of the \\nCGST Act and would include not only the service charges but also the \\nvalue of any goods or services used by him for supplying the job work \\nservices, if recovered from the principal. Doubts have been raised \\nwhether the value of moulds and dies, jigs and fixtures or tools which \\nhave been provided by the principal to the job worker and have been \\nused by the latter for providing job work services would be included in \\nthe value of job work services. In this regard, attention is invited to \\nsection 15 of the CGST Act which lays down the principles for \\ndetermining the value of any supply under GST. Importantly, clause (b) \\nof sub-section (2) of section 15 of the CGST Act provides that any \\namount that the supplier is liable to pay in relation to the supply but \\nwhich has been incurred by the recipient will form part of the valuation \\nfor that particular supply, provided it has not been included in the price \\nfor such supply. Accordingly, it is clarified that the value of such moulds \\nand dies, jigs and fixtures or tools may not be included in the value of job \\nwork services provided its value has been factored in the price for the \\nsupply of such services by the job worker.',\n",

CKD/SKD/Lots for movement of Export/Import consignment \\n \\nCKD/SKD/Lots supply type can be used for movement of the big \\nconsignment in batches. When One ‘Tax Invoice’ or ‘Bill of Entry’ is \\nthere, but the goods are moved in batches from supplier to recipient with \\nthe ‘Delivery Challan’, then this option can be used. Here, the batch \\nconsignment will have ‘Delivery Challan’ along with copy of the ‘Tax \\nInvoice’ or ‘Bill of Entry’ in movement. The last batch will have the \\n‘Delivery Challan’ along with original ‘Tax Invoice’ or ‘Bill of Entry’. \\n \\nSome exports or imports will be in big consignment and may not be \\nmoved in one go from the supplier or to the recipient. Hence, CKD/SKD/ \\nLots supply can be used for this. \\n \\nFor CKD/SKD/Lots of Export consignment, the ‘Bill To’ Party will be \\nURP or GSTIN of SEZ Unit with state as ‘Other Country’ and shipping \\naddress and PIN code will be of the location (airport/shipping \\nyard/border check post) from where the consignment is moving out from \\nthe country. \\n \\nFor CKD/SKD/Lots of Import consignment, the ‘Bill From’ Party will be \\nURP or GSTIN of SEZ Unit with state as ‘Other Country’ and \\ndispatching address and PIN code will be of the location (airport/ \\nshipping yard/border check post) from where the consignment is entered \\nthe country. \\n3. Shipping address in case of export supply type \\n \\nFor Export supply type, the ‘Bill To’ Party will be URP or GSTIN of \\nSEZ Unit with state as ‘Other Country’ and shipping address and PIN \\ncode will be of the location (airport/shipping yard/border check post) \\nfrom where the consignment is moving out from the country. \\n4. Dispatching address in case of import supply type \\n \\nFor Import supply, the ‘Bill From’ Party will be URP or GSTIN of SEZ \\nUnit with state as ‘Other Country’ and dispatching address and PIN code \\nwill be of the location (airport/shipping yard/border check post) from \\nwhere the consignment is entered the country. \\n5. ‘Bill To - Ship To’ transactions \\n \\nThere are four types of ‘Bill To - Ship To’ transactions. These types \\ndepend upon the number of parties involved in the billing and movement \\nof the goods. The following paras explain the same. \\n\\uf0d8 Regular: This is a regular or normal transaction, where Billing and \\ngoods movement are happening between two parties - consignor and \\nconsignee. That is, the Bill and goods movement from consignor to \\nconsignee takes place directly. \\n\\uf0d8 Bill To - Ship to: In this type of transaction, three parties are \\ninvolved. Billing takes places between consignor and consignee, but \\nthe goods move from consignor to the third party as per the request \\nof the consignee.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 26 \\nElectronic Way Bill \\n675 \\n\\uf0d8 Bill From - Dispatch from: In this type of transaction also, three \\nparties are involved. Billing takes places between consignor and \\nconsignee, but the goods are moved by the consignor from the third \\nparty to the consignee. \\n\\uf0d8 Combination of both: This is the combination of above two \\ntransactions and involves four parties. Billing takes places between \\nconsignor and consignee, but the goods are moved by the consignor \\nfrom the third party to the fourth party, as per the consignee’s \\nrequest. \\n6. Changes in Bulk Generation Tool \\nNew columns have been added in the Bulk Generation Tool. The same \\nwill be released on 16th November, 2018. \\nForthcoming changes in e-Way bill system  \\n1. Auto calculation of route distance based on PIN code for generation of \\nEWB Now, E-way bill system is being enabled to auto calculate the \\nroute distance for movement of goods, based on the Postal PIN codes of \\nsource and destination locations. That is, the e-waybill system will \\ncalculate and display the actual distance between the supplier and \\nrecipient addresses. User is allowed to enter the actual distance as per his \\nmovement of goods. However, it will be limited to 10% more than the \\ndisplayed distance for entry. That is, if the system has displayed the \\ndistance between Place A and B, based on the PIN codes, as 655 KMs, \\nthen the user can enter the actual distance up to 720KMs (655KMs + \\n65KMs). In case, the source PIN and destination PIN are same, the user \\ncan enter up to a maximum of 100KMs only. If the PIN entered is \\nincorrect, the system would alert the user as INVALID PIN CODE. \\nHowever, he can continue entering the distance. Further, these e-way \\nbills having INVALID PIN codes are flagged for review by the \\ndepartment.  \\n \\nRoute distance calculation between source and destination uses the data \\nfrom various electronic sources. This data employs various attributes, for \\nexample: road class, direction of travel, average speed, traffic data etc. \\nThese attributes are picked up from traffic that is on National highways, \\nstate highways, expressways, district highways as well as main roads \\ninside the cities. A proprietary logic is then used for approximating the \\ndistance between two postal pin codes. The distance thus derived is then \\nprovided as the motorable distance at that point of time.  \\n2.  Blocking of generation of multiple E-Way Bills on one Invoice/ \\ndocument Based on the representation received by the transporters, the \\ngovernment has decided not to allow generation of multiple e-way bills \\nbased on one invoice, by any party – consignor, consignee and \\ntransporter. That is, once E-way Bill is generated with an invoice \\nnumber, then none of the parties - consignor, consignee or transporter - \\ncan generate the E-Way Bill with the same invoice number. One Invoice,',\n",

Extension of E-Way Bill in case consignment is in transit the transporters \\nhad represented to incorporate the provision to extend the E-way Bill, \\nwhen the goods are in transit. The transit means the goods could be on \\nRoad or in Warehouse. This facility is being incorporated in the next \\nversion for the extension of E-way Bill. During the extension of the e-\\nway bill, the user is prompted to answer whether the Consignment is in \\nTransit or in Movement. On selection of in Transit, the address details of \\nthe transit place need to be provided. On selection of in Movement the \\nsystem will prompt the user to enter the Place and Vehicle details from \\nwhere the extension is required. In both these scenarios, the destination \\nPIN will be considered from the PART A of the E-way Bill for \\ncalculation of distance for movement and validity date. Route distance \\nwill be calculated as explained above.  \\n4.  Blocking of Inter-State Transactions for Composition dealers As per the \\nGST Act, the composition tax payers are not supposed to do Inter-State \\ntransactions. Hence next version will not allow generation of e-way bill \\nfor inter-State movement, if the supplier is composition tax payer. Also, \\nthe supplies of composition tax payers will not be allowed to enter any of \\nthe taxes under CGST or SGST for intrastate transactions. In case of \\nComposition tax payer, document type of Tax Invoice will not be \\nenabled. \\n[www.ewaybill.nic.in , dated 25-3-2019] \\nE-Way Bill – Update on Blocking of E-WAY Bill (EWB) generation facility, \\nafter 1 December, 2020 \\n1.

The various modes of generating OTP are explained \\nbelow:  \\n1.  SMS: OTP will be sent to your registered mobile number as SMS.  \\n2.  On ‘Sandes’ app: Sandes is a messaging app provided by government so \\nthat you can send and receive messages. You may download and install \\nthe Sandes app on your registered mobile number and receive the OTP in \\nit.  \\n3.  Using ‘NIC-GST-Shield’ app: ‘NIC-GST-Shield’ is a mobile app \\nprovided by e-Way Bill /e-Invoice System, so that OTP can be generated \\nby using the app. This app can be downloaded only from the e-Waybill / \\ne-invoice portal from the link ‘Main Menu2-Factor Authentication Install \\nNIC-GST-Shield’.

On opening the \\napp, OTP is displayed. You may enter this OTP and continue the \\nauthentication. The OTP gets refreshed after every 30 seconds. You will \\nnot require internet or any dependency on mobile network for generating \\nthe OTP on this app.  \\nRegistration for 2-Factor Authentication:  \\nOn logging to e-Waybill System go to Main Menu2 Factor Authentication \\nand confirm the registration. Once confirmed, the system will ask OTP along \\nwith username and password. The OTP authentication is based on individual user \\naccounts.

Her letter dated May 4 says, “I would urge the \\nofficials to expedite the process of approval of GST practitioners. A proactive \\napproach in facilitating the enrolment and helping the applicants in case they \\nhave committed any bona fide mistakes while making the application will only \\nfurther our cause of achieving a trade-friendly image for the department.” \\nGovernment officials TOI spoke to admit that there are a few conditions for \\nbeing a GST practitioner: He/she must be a citizen of India, must be of sound \\nmind, should not have been adjudged as an insolvent and should not have been',\n",

A Mumbai-based chartered accountant says, “The \\napplication had to be made online, the enrolling authority can be Centre or state. \\nIn my experience, several applications where the enrolling authority was at state \\nlevel faced delays.” \\nOn a CA discussion portal, the general advice being given to participants is: \\nThe best option is to apply again for registration as a GST practitioner, but with a \\ndifferent email and phone number, and also selecting the enrolling authority as \\nCentre. \\nThere are other professionals who have been lucky enough to have got \\nregistered within one-three weeks. In the backdrop of the CBIC chief’s letter, \\nthose waiting anxiously have revived their hopes. \\nOnce registered as a GST practitioner, an individual can file various forms on \\nbehalf of clients, make deposits for credit into the electronic cash ledger and \\nappear as an authorised representative. He or she can, after confirmation from \\nclients, also file a refund claim or an application for amendment or cancellation \\nof the registration.

Principle of Natural Justice  \\nThe definition of “Natural Justice” has wide coverage, has no uniform & \\nconfined meaning. The principles of natural justice is a common law principle \\napplicable in all cases of adjudicating process in judicial, quasi judicial as well as \\nadministrative proceedings. The principles of natural justice are based on the \\nfollowing essential elements:  \\n1. Audi alteram pattern which basically necessarily means that both sides \\nshall be heard in person by the adjudicator before decision/order is \\npassed in the matter.  \\n2. The minimum adjournment of personal hearing should be allowed as per \\nthe statutory provisions of tax laws. \\n3. Nemo judex in re sua - the authority passing the orders should be free \\nfrom bias and prejudice. \\n4. No man should judge his own case. This implies that affected party \\ncannot be adjudicating authority for his own case. \\n5. The parties to a proceedings must have due notice of when the Court will \\nbe proceeded in the matter. \\n6. The adequate time should be given in the hearing notice and notice must \\ncontain time, place and nature of hearing. \\n7.

Both sides are also permitted to \\ntake adjournment on reasonable grounds for the maximum three occasions.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 29 \\nAdjudication Proceeding \\n727 \\nHowever, there is no fetter in further adjournment of the matter if the authority \\nfeels that the matter needs to be adjourned in the interest of justice.  \\n5. Role of adjudicating authority  \\nThe adjudication proceeding is carried by the departmental officers \\ndepending upon monetary limits and they discharge functions in the capacity of \\nquasi-judicial officers. The officers vested with power of adjudication are \\nexpected to use it with utmost care and caution, free from any prejudice or bias or \\nunfairness. It is very important on the part of the adjudicating officers to know \\nand understand the facts of the case, examine these facts properly and to apply \\ncorrectly the statutory provisions of the relevant statute. The adjudicating officer \\nshould pass the final order after thorough verification of the relevant documents \\nof the case, due study of the written submission filed by the parties and \\nsubsequent discussion in the personal hearing.  \\n6. The basic principles of adjudication  \\n1. The adjudication proceeding is based on the principle of natural justice \\nand the said principle to be followed by the adjudicating officers to \\ndecide a case/pass order.  \\n2. The adjudicating authorities to provide reasonable time for adjudication \\nas per the statutory provisions and time limitation provided in the Act.  \\n3. The adjudicating authority may, is sufficient cause is shown, at any stage \\nof proceeding, grant time by adjournment of personal hearing for three \\noccasions and no such adjournment is normally allowed thereafter. \\n4. The adjudicating authority should exercise their powers fairly, \\nreasonably and impartially in a just manner and they should not decide a \\nmatter on the basis of any enquiry unknown to the party, but should on \\nthe basis of supported documentary evidence on record. \\n5. The decision of adjudicating authority should not be biased, arbitrary or \\nbased on mere conjectures, assumptions and presumption of the facts. \\n6. The adjudication order must be a speaking order giving clear findings on \\nall the points raised in the show cause notice, after due consideration of \\nsubmissions made by the party and final decision in clear terms. \\n7. The adjudication order should be in accordance with precedent judgment \\nand not violation of judicial discipline. \\n8. The adjudicating authority should decide the case by proper application \\nof mind and order should be self speaking order. \\n9. The adjudication order should quantify the duty demanded and order \\nportion must contain the correct provisions of law under which duty is \\nconfirmed and penalty is imposed. \\n10. The adjudication order of decided case, if remanded by the appellate \\nauthority for de novo adjudication, it should be adjudicated in de novo \\nproceedings by the same authority who had earlier adjudicated the case.',\n",
              " '728 \\nGST Smart Guide  \\nChap. 29 \\n11. The adjudicating authority should take a decision on request of the party \\nfor cross-examination considering the facts and circumstances of the \\ncase. \\n12. The adjudicating officers should exercise powers of adjudication within \\nthe monetary limits available to them.  \\n13. The adjudicating authority should not pass order in a routine manner as \\nper precedent decision and he should give his own findings as per the \\nchange of circumstances, if any, and prevalent laws. \\n14. Adjudication order has to be dated and signed by the adjudicating \\nauthority. \\n15. The adjudicating authority cannot pass two orders on the same show \\ncause notice but corrigendum can be issued on minor omission of facts \\nwithout changing the main order.  \\n16. The adjudicating authority should not pass order beyond the scope of \\nshow cause notice and no new points should not be discussed in the order \\nwhich is not a part of show cause notice. \\n17. The adjudicating authority should communicate the order within a \\nreasonable time after grant of personal hearing. He is also expected to \\nkeep ’Record of Personal Hearing’ and to provide signed copy of the \\nsame to the parties. \\n18. Adjudication \\norder \\nmust \\nbe \\ndispatched \\nby \\nregistered \\npost \\nacknowledgement due or speed post with POD option and the \\nacknowledgment of delivery must be kept on record. The copy of POD \\nmust be provided to the parties on their request. \\n7. Judicial discipline  \\nThe adjudicating officers should follow the principles of judicial discipline or \\nprecedent judgments before passing of any judicial decision. The judicial \\ndiscipline is a vital factor in adjudication proceedings. The adjudicating officers \\nshould be bound by the precedent judgments of the higher authorities in the \\nidentical cases. Then only the judicial decision would be just, fair, right, \\nsubstantial and universally acceptable. The judicial discipline is self-discipline \\nand it is an inbuilt mechanism in the system itself in adjudication proceedings. \\nThis is the minimum discipline and decorum to be maintained by quasi judicial/ \\njudicial fraternity. The principles of natural justice and judicial discipline are \\nboth sides of the same coin in adjudication proceedings.  \\n8. Time limits for adjudication in cases of normal period of limitation \\nAs per Section 73(10) of the CGST Act, 2017, the proper officer is required \\nto issue the order within three years from the due date for furnishing of annual \\nreturn for the financial year to which the tax not paid or short paid or input tax \\ncredit wrongly availed or utilised relates to any reason other than fraud or any \\nwilful misstatement or suppression of facts.',\n",

Further, the last dates of filing of the “Annual Return” under Section 44 of \\nthe CGST Act, 2017, for the Financial Years 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20 are as \\nbelow',\n",

It may be seen \\nthat the last date for filing the Annual Returns for the FYs of 2017-18, 2018-19 & \\n2019-20 is already over. As a result, the time limit of three years/five years for \\nissuance of orders under Section 73 & Section 74 of the CGST Act, 2017 has \\nalready kicked in. If the issuance of SCNs is pushed to close proximity of the end \\ndates/last dates, it may leave very little time with the adjudicating authority to \\npass orders within stipulated period mentioned in sub-section (10) of Section \\n73/Section 74. This might result in a situation where either the adjudicating \\nauthority is not able to pass orders within prescribed time period or quality of \\nadjudication suffers. It is felt that the present situation warrants for extra efforts \\non the part of field formations and strict monitoring at supervisory level. \\n5. Accordingly, Board desires that Principal Director General/Director \\nGeneral(s)/Principal Chief Commissioner(s)/Chief Commissioner(s) within their \\njurisdiction may take stock of the pending investigation cases/other cases which \\nwarrant issuance of show cause notices and take appropriate action to ensure \\ntimely completion of investigation(s) and issuance of SCNs well before the last \\ndate.

Writ petition in respect of Tax laws  \\nThere is availability of statutory provision under Section 117 of the CGST \\nAct, 2017, by virtue of the said provisions the affected party may file appeal \\nbefore the High Court aggrieved by the order passed in appeal by the Appellate \\nTribunal or order passed by the quasi-judiciary authorities in the matter of tax \\nlaws. The High Court will admit appeal, if the High Court is satisfied that the \\ncase involves a substantial question of law or facts. \\nEven though the remedies are available in tax laws for adverse statutory \\nprovisions, there is constitutional provision to represent to tax litigations before \\nthe High Court by way of writ petition under Article 226 and Article 227 of the \\nConstitution of India. The tax litigations mainly relating to the following may be \\nfiled writ petition before the High Court in the following situations: \\n1. When the GST officer visited a place of business or any other place for \\nthe purpose of inspection, search and seizure of goods, documents, books \\nor things liable to confiscation under Section 139 of the CGST Act, 2017 \\nwithout obtaining authorisation from the proper officer not below the \\nrank of a joint Commissioner.  \\n2. When there is illegal arrest under Section 69 of the CGST Act, 2017. \\n3. When there is issuance of illegal summon to give evidence or produce \\ndocuments for investigation under Section 70 of the CGST Act, 2017. \\n4. When frivolous show cause notices issued for recovery of illegal demand \\nunder Section 73 and Section 74 of the CGST Act, 2017. \\n5. Where the benefits available under statutory provisions are denied to the \\ntaxpayers or assessees by the authority in statutory power. \\n6. When the provisions of an Act and Rules is challengeable for \\nconstitutional validity. \\n7. When the provisions prescribed through Notifications, Instruction, Order \\nand Circular has been misinterpreted and held illegal or ultra vires. \\n8. When the registered person fails to avail input tax credits benefit under \\nTransitional provision under Section 140 of the CGST Act, 2017. \\n9. The tax authority may file writ petition to seek stay on payment of \\nerroneous refund claim sanctioned by the sanctioning authority. \\n5. Maintainability of writ petition  \\nArticle 226 & Article 227 of the Constitution of India, grants wide powers to \\nthe High Courts, and taxpayers can avail this opportunity for management of tax \\nlitigations. Normally, High Courts are reluctant to interfere if there is adequate \\nefficacious alternative statutory remedies are available under tax laws. If',\n",

Case Laws  \\nThe Apex Court decision in the case of D.R. Enterprises v Assistant \\nCollector of Customs, reported in 2015 (322) E.L.T. 795 (SC), held that the \\npowers of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, while issuing \\nappropriate writs, are very wide. Even if there is an alternate remedy that may not \\npreclude the High Court from exercising the jurisdiction in a particular case. In \\nthe face of alternate statutory remedies, when the High Court declines to exercise \\nthe jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, it is a self-imposed \\nrestriction only. [para 21] \\nIn the case of Asst. Collector, Central Excise v Dunlop India Ltd. and Ors \\n[1985 (19) E.L.T. 22 (SC)], it was held that Article 226 is not meant to short \\ncircuit or circumvent statutory provisions and the High Court must entertain the \\nwrit petition only when statutory remedies are entirely ill-suited to meet the \\ndemands of extraordinary situations and where interference is necessary to \\nprevent public injury and vindication of public justice. \\nThe Apex Court decision in the case of Kuntesh Gupta v Management of \\nHindu Kanya Mahavidyalaya, reported in 1987 (32) E.L.T. 8 (SC), held that it is \\nwell established that an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to the \\nmaintainability of a writ petition. When an authority has acted wholly without \\njurisdiction the High Court should not refuse to exercise its jurisdiction on the \\nexistence of alternative remedy under Article 226 of the Constitution. [Para 12]. \\nThe Apex Court decision in the case of Collector of Customs v Ramchand \\nSobhraj Wadhwani AIR 1961 SC 1506, it was held that the remedy under Article \\n226 by way of judicial review is purely discretion. Where the petitioner fails to \\navail of the effective statutory alternative remedy within the prescribed time due \\nto his own fault, he cannot be permitted to seek remedy under Article 226 of the \\nConstitution of India. \\nIn the case of Titaghar Paper Mills Co Ltd. v State of Orissa (2 SCC 433), a \\nBench of three judges of the Apex Court held that where efficacious statutory \\nalternative remedy is available in the statute by way of an appeal and second \\nappeal under the Sales Tax Act and the petitioner failed to avail of relief in the \\nappeals, the writ petition is not maintainable in law. \\nThe powers of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 form a part and \\nparcel of the basic structure of the Constitution and cannot be overwritten and \\nnullified as held by the Constitutional Bench in L. Chandra Kumar v UOI - 1997 \\n(92) E.L.T. 318 (SC).',\n",

No sufficient time was afforded to the \\npetitioner to represent his case; (b) order passed ex parte in nature, does not \\nassign any sufficient reasons even decipherable from the record, as to how the \\nofficer could determine the amount due and payable by the assessee. The order, \\nex parte in nature, passed in violation of the principles of natural justice, entails \\ncivil consequences.” \\nThe existence of alternate remedy does not bar exercise of writ jurisdiction if \\norder is challenged for want of jurisdiction. \\nThe High Court has the authority to decide whether to accept or reject a writ \\npetition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. However, the Hon’ble \\nSupreme Court in the case of Magadh Sugar & Energy Ltd. v State of Bihar LL \\n2021 SC 495 held that existence of alternate remedy does not bar exercise of writ \\njurisdiction if order is challenged for want of jurisdiction.

Introduction \\nThe supply of goods or services or both in the course of import into the \\nterritory of India shall be deemed to be supply of goods, or services or both in the \\ncourse of inter-State trade or commerce. \\nThe import of goods or services are to be treated as deemed inter-State \\nsupplies and subject to Integrated Tax. \\nThus, the IGST on import of services would be leviable under the IGST Act, \\n2017 and the IGST on import of goods would be levied under the Customs Act, \\n1962 read with Customs Tariff Act, 1975. \\n2. Meaning of Imported goods \\nSection 2(10) of the IGST Act, 2017 defines “Import of goods” with its \\ngrammatical variations and cognate expressions, means bringing goods into India \\nfrom a place outside India. \\nThe term ‘brining goods’ in to India means ‘physically’ goods should be \\nbrought into India and “import of goods “commences when the goods cross the \\nCustoms frontiers of India, it may be land, air and territorial waters of India. \\nThus “import of goods’ necessarily implies goods to be brought physically in \\nIndia. \\n3. Important Definition  \\nSection 2(4) of the IGST Act, 2017 defines “Customs frontiers of India” \\nmeans the limits of a customs area as defined in Section 2 of the Customs Act, \\n1962 (52 of 1962). \\nSection 2(25) of the Customs Act, 1962 defines “imported goods” means any \\ngoods bought into India from a place outside India but does not include goods \\nwhich have been cleared for home consumption. \\nSection 2(27) of the Customs Act, defines “India “includes the territorial \\nwaters of India.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 32 \\nImport of Goods and Services \\n763 \\nSection 2(28) of the Customs Act, defines Indian Customs Waters” means \\nthe waters extending into the sea upto the limit of contiguous zone of India under \\nSection 5 of the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone \\nand other Maritime Zones Act,1976 and includes any bay, gulf, harbour, creek or \\ntidal river. \\nSection 2(56) of the CGST Act, 2017 defines “India” means the territory of \\nIndia as referred to in article 1 of the Constitution, its territorial waters, seabed \\nand sub-soil underlying such waters, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone \\nor any other maritime zone as referred to in the Territorial Waters, Continental \\nShelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and other Maritime Zones Act, 1976, and the \\nair space above its territory and territorial waters. \\nSection 2(11) “Customs area”, means the area of a customs station and \\nincludes any area in which import goods or export goods are ordinarily kept \\nbefore clearance by Customs Authorities. \\nThe term “importer” has not been defined in IGST Act but as per Section \\n2(26) of the Customs Act, “importer”, in relation to any goods at any time \\nbetween their importation and the time when they are cleared for home \\nconsumption, includes any owner, beneficial owner or any person holding \\nhimself out to be the importer. \\n4. Levy of duty on imported goods  \\nAny goods imported into India are chargeable to duties of Customs under \\nSection 12 of the Customs Act, 1962 at rates specified in the Customs Tariff Act, \\n1975. \\nAs per Section 12 of the Customs Act, levy of duties of customs is on the \\ngoods imported into India. Import commences when the goods cross the \\nterritorial waters and is completed when bill of entry for home consumption is \\nfiled. Taxable event occurs when bill of entry for home consumption is filed; \\nsame is also applicable for warehouse goods. \\nAs per Section 7(2) of the IGST Act, 2017, Supply of goods imported into \\nthe territory of India, till they cross Customs frontier of India, shall be treated to \\nbe supply of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Further as per \\nSection 8(1)(ii) of the IGST Act, 2017, goods imported into the territory of India \\ntill they cross the Customs frontiers of India shall not be treated as intra-State \\nsupply of goods. \\nIn view of the above interpretation IGST shall be levied on imported goods \\nonce the same cross the Customs frontiers of India i.e. on inter-State supply of \\ngoods. \\nAs per Section 5(1) of the IGST Act, 2017, Integrated tax on goods imported \\ninto India shall be levied and collected in accordance with the provisions of \\nSection 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 on the value as determined under the \\nsaid Act at the point when duties of Customs are levied on the said goods under \\nSection 12 of the Customs Act, 1962.',\n",

In \\naddition, GST compensation cess, may also be leviable on certain luxury and \\ndemerit goods under the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Cess \\nAct, 2017 and also recently levy of Social Welfare Surcharge. \\nThe Customs Tariff Act, 1975 has accordingly been amended to provide for \\nlevy of Integrated Tax, the Compensation Cess, Social welfare Surcharge on \\nimported goods. Accordingly, goods which are imported into India shall, in \\naddition to the Basic Customs duty, be liable to Integrated Tax at such rate as is \\nleviable under the IGST Act, 2017 on similar article on its supply in India. \\n5. Duty Calculation \\nIGST rate: IGST rates have been notified through Notification No. 1/2017-\\nI.T. (Rate), dated 28-06-2017. IGST rate on any product can be ascertained by \\nselecting the correct Sl. No. as per description of goods and tariff headings in the \\nrelevant schedules of the notification.

C.B.E. & C. \\nCircular No. 3/1/2018-IGST, dated 25-5-2018. \\nThe Circular No. 3/1/2018-IGST, dated 25.5.2018 has been rescinded by \\nCBIC, Circular No. 04/01/2019-GST dated 1’st February, 2019 as the provision \\nof the CGST (Amendment) Act, 2018 and SGST Amendment Acts of the \\nrespective States have been brought into force w.e.f.1.2.2019.

Levy of IGST on High Sea Sale Transactions  \\nHigh Seas Sale is sale of goods by the original importer to another party \\nwhen the imported goods are yet on high seas. High seas sale happened prior to \\nimportation and filing of bill of entry for customs clearance. In such situations, \\nthe bill of entry for Customs clearance shall be filed by the person who purchase \\nthese imported goods on high seas basis from the original importer. \\nIn terms of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the IGST Act, 2017, provides that \\nthe Integrated Tax on goods imported shall be levied and collected in accordance \\nwith the provisions of Section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 on the value as \\ndetermined under the said Act at the point when duties of customs are levied on \\nthe said goods under section 12 of the Customs Act, 1962. \\nIn terms of Section 7(2) of the IGST Act, 2017, which has specified that \\nsupply of goods imported into the territory of India, till they cross the customs \\nfrontiers of India, shall be treated to be a supply of goods in the course of inter-\\nState trade or commerce. As such High Seas Sale is also covered under IGST \\nAct, 2017. \\nIn view of confusion for the levy and collection of Integrated Tax and \\nCustoms Duty on High Seas Sale of imported goods under GST regime, the \\nC.B.E. & C., has issued clarification vide Circular No. 33/2017-Cus., dated  \\n1-8-2017 [2017 (352) E.L.T.

The extract of the relevant paras are \\nreproduced as under: \\nThe issue has been examined in the Board. ‘High Sea Sales' is a common \\ntrade practice whereby the original importer sells the goods to a third person \\nbefore the goods are entered for customs clearance. After the High sea sale of the \\ngoods, the Customs declarations i.e. Bill of Entry etc. is filed by the person who \\nbuys the goods from the original importer during the said sale. In the past, CBEC\",\n",

[Circular \\nNo. 32/2004-Cus., dated 11-5-2004 refers]. \\nAs mentioned earlier, all inter-state transactions are subject to IGST. High \\nsea sales of imported goods are akin to inter-State transactions. Owing to this, it \\nwas presented to the Board as to whether the high sea sales of imported goods \\nwould be chargeable to IGST twice i.e. at the time of Customs clearance under \\nsub-section (7) of section 3 of Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and also separately \\nunder Section 5 of The Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. \\nGST council has deliberated the levy of Integrated Goods and Services Tax \\non high sea sales in the case of imported goods. The council has decided that \\nIGST on high sea sale (s) transactions of imported goods, whether one or \\nmultiple, shall be levied and collected only at the time of importation i.e. when \\nthe import declarations are filed before the Customs authorities for the customs \\nclearance purposes for the first time. Further, value addition accruing in each \\nsuch high sea sale shall form part of the value on which IGST is collected at the \\ntime of clearance. \\nThe above decision of the GST council is already envisioned in the \\nprovisions of sub-section (12) of Section 3 of Customs Tariff Act, 1975 \\ninasmuch as in respect of imported goods, all duties, taxes, Cesses etc. shall be \\ncollected at the time of importation i.e. when the import declarations are filed \\nbefore the customs authorities for the customs clearance purposes. The importer \\n(last buyer in the chain) would be required to furnish the entire chain of \\ndocuments, such as original Invoice, high-seas-sales-contract, details of service \\ncharges/commission paid etc, to establish a link between the first contracted price \\nof the goods and the last transaction. In case of a doubt regarding the truth or \\naccuracy of the declared value, the department may reject the declared \\ntransaction value and determination the price of the imported goods as provided \\nin the Customs Valuation rules. \\n14.

Directorate of Systems have issued Advisory No. 25/2019 dated \\n(web link) laying down requirement of mandatory uploading on e-SANCHIT, the \\nInvoice/Invoice cum packing list and Bill of Lading/Airway bill etc. for every \\nBill of Entry and subsequent declaration of document code and IRNs in the Bill \\nof Entry.  \\nWith effect from 02.12.2019, for every Invoice and Bill of Lading/Airway \\nBill declared in the Bill of Entry, the reference of IRN generated from \\neSANCHIT with the relevant document code as given above must be provided. \\nThe reference of the above document codes from e-SANCHIT in the Bills of \\nEntry has been made mandatory in System.  \\n4. As regards all the other supporting documents (such as Country of Origin \\nCertificate (COO), licence/permission from any Government Agency (PGA) in \\nrelation to the eligibility for import/clearances or claim of duty exemption), it is \\nemphasised that to make Customs duty truly paperless, uploading of these \\ndocuments through e-SANCHIT either by beneficiary or by PGAs, should be \\nensured administratively. Therefore, the field offices must ensure that no physical \\ncopy of any supporting document is submitted and every relevant document is \\nsubmitted only electronically via e-SANCHIT either by the beneficiary or by the \\nParticipating Government Agency. DG (Systems) would also enforce the same in \\ndue course.  \\n5. The above changes have been separately communicated to the various \\nCHA associations and RES software providers. However, the same may further \\nbe given publicity by way of Trade notices. The above two changes may kindly \\nbe given wide publicity and the Trade may be guided suitably to ensure that there \\nis minimum disruption after their implementation.  \\n15.

Express Industry Council of India (EICI) has requested \\nto introduce 'Auto Out of Charge' for such imported shipments as this will help in \\nmitigating delays in clearance of Express Cargo at the international courier \\nterminals.  \\n4. Directorate General of Systems and Data Management is in technical \\nagreement with the proposal of EICI to implement 'Auto Out of Charge' under \\nECCS.  \\n5. Over the years, cross-border movement of express cargo has increased \\nsignificantly which mandates simplification of procedure. It is also observed that \\nsending a CBE after X-ray screening to the Shed Superintendent/Appraiser, \\nmerely for giving out of charge order, adds an avoidable step in the automated \\nclearance process.

Faceless assessment under customs \\nAssessment is the processes used to carry out by the Customs Officer at the \\nport of import for the determination of Customs duty on the basis of physical \\ndocuments such as Bill of Entry for Customs clearance of imported goods \\nthrough EDI system and goods examination report. The physical documents \\nverification and examination of goods for Customs clearances has been replaced \\nby the Faceless assessment.  \\nFaceless Assessment, a component of the Turant Customs programme, is a \\npath breaking initiative aimed at introducing anonymity and uniformity in \\nCustoms assessments pan India. Faceless Assessment is a paperless process \\nwhere a Bill of Entry that is identified for scrutiny is assigned to an assessing \\nofficer who is physically located at a Customs station, which is not the Port of \\nImport in the Customs Automated System. It separates the assessment process \\nfrom the physical location of Port of Import, using a technology platform. The \\nassessment part of the Customs clearance procedure would be delinked with the \\ngeographical location where the goods are available for examination. Faceless \\nassessment has been rolled out in phases manner and has been scheduled to cover \\nthe entire country by 31st October 2020.  \\n After running pilot programmes since August 2019, the first formal phase of \\nFaceless Assessment commenced in Bengaluru and Chennai in June 2020. It',\n",

This was followed by other phases covering new Customs locations and \\nnew items of import. After running pilot programmes since August 2019, the first \\nformal phase of Faceless Assessment commenced in Bengaluru and Chennai in \\nJune 2020. This was followed by other phases covering new Customs locations \\nand new items of import. Assessment has now been firmed up. Faceless \\nAssessment is expected to have considerable impact on India’s performance on \\nvarious independent global assessments and boost the country’s trade \\ncompetitiveness, including ease of doing business.  \\n26.1 Need for the Faceless Assessment \\nPrevious Customs clearance processes involved myriad requirements that \\nwere manually operated, complex, sequential and time-consuming. Migration of \\ncore Customs process to a technology platform opened-up a host of opportunities \\nto reform the border clearance ecosystem. Earlier, the importers, exporters and \\nother actors engaged in international trade (shipping lines, freight forwarders \\netc.) were required to prepare and submit large amount of information to border \\nagencies to comply with various regulatory requirements. Also, this information \\nhad to be submitted separately to several different agencies, which their own \\nspecific automated or manual systems to process the data. This used to put a \\nserious burden both on Government and trade. Thus, early initiatives by Customs \\nfocused on expeditious transmission of documents between Participating \\nGovernment Agencies (PGA) as well as parallel processing of documents.  \\n26.2 Key objectives of Faceless Assessment \\n \\n(i) Anonymity in assessment for reduced physical interface between trade \\nand Customs  \\n \\n(ii) Speedier Customs clearances through efficient utilisation of manpower  \\n (iii) Greater uniformity of assessment across locations  \\n (iv) Promoting sector specific and functional specialisation in assessment  \\nIt is estimated that the Faceless Assessment initiative will help slash release \\ntime to only few minutes and few hours, substantially lower than the present \\nclearance times averaging three to four days. Accordingly, Faceless Assessment \\nis expected to have considerable impact on India’s performance on various \\nindependent global assessments and boost the country’s trade competitiveness, \\nincluding ease of doing business. Faceless Assessment also offers many other \\nadvantages to both trade and CBIC. \\nA pilot of the initiative was initiated last year by CBIC and post validation of \\nthe expected outcomes; it has been decided to roll out the programme nationally. \\nThese Pilot Programmes helped test Faceless Assessment first in the same zone, \\nthen across zones. Faceless Assessment is now being extended across all \\nCustoms ports in India to user a more modern, efficient, and professional \\nCustoms administration, with resultant benefits for trade and industry.',\n",

Case Law \\n813 \\n \\n1. Introduction \\nGenerally, export is one of the most important business activities in the \\npresent day economy for any country. Exports of goods and services result in \\ninflow of foreign exchange earnings of the country. So, higher the volume of \\nexports brings higher inflow of foreign exchange to the country resulting higher \\nrate of growth of country’s economy.  \\nIn Simple words “Export “means when goods or services are sent from our \\ncountry to another country against consideration which translate in realization of \\nforeign exchange earnings. As per Section 2(18) of Customs Act, 1962. “Export \\n“means taking goods out of India to a place outside India. \\n2. Meaning of “Export of goods and services” \\nUnder GST regime the definition of export has been defined vide sub-section \\n(5) of Section 2 of IGST Act, 2017, as “Export of goods” with its grammatical \\nvariations and cognate expressions, means taking goods out of India to a place \\noutside India; and sub-section (6) of Section 2 of IGST Act, 2017 defines - \\n“Export of services “mean the supply of any service when,— \\n \\n(i) the supplier of service is located in India; \\n \\n(ii) the recipient of service is located outside India; \\n (iii) the place of supply of service is outside India; \\n (iv) the payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service \\nin convertible foreign exchange; and \\n \\n(v) the supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely \\nestablishments of a distinct person in accordance with Explanation 1 in \\nSection 8 of IGST Act, 2017. \\nThus, if the recipient of goods and services or both is located outside India, \\nthen these supplies will be considered as export; Section 2(56) of CGST Act, \\n2017 defines “India” mean the territory of India as referred to in Article 1 of the \\nConstitution, its territorial waters, sea-bed and sub-soil underlying such waters, \\ncontinental shelf, exclusive economic zone or any other maritime zones as \\nreferred to in the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone \\nand other Maritime Zones Act, 1976 (80 of 1976), and the air space above its \\nterritory and territorial waters. \\n3. Treatment of Exports under GST \\nIn the GST regime, as per the provisions of IGST Act, 2017 supplies of \\ngoods and services for exports are to be treated as “Zero rated supplies” implying \\nthat registered taxable person exporting goods and services shall follow the \\nprocedure of export under bond or letter of undertaking without payment of \\nIntegrated Tax and claim refund of unutilized input tax credit or on payment of \\nintegrated tax and claim refund of the tax so paid on goods and services exported.',\n",

Scope of zero rated Supply \\nSection 16 of the IGST Act, 2017 provides the scope of zero-rated supply; \\nthe relevant portion of IGST Act, 2017 is reproduced as under: \\n“16. (1) “zero rated supply” means any of the following supplies of \\ngoods or services or both, namely:— \\n \\n(a) export of goods or services or both; or \\n \\n(b) supply of goods or services or both [authorised operations] to a \\nSpecial Economic Zone developer or a Special Economic Zone unit. \\n(2) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (5) of section 17 of the \\nCentral Goods and Services Tax Act, credit of input tax may be availed for \\nmaking zero-rated supplies; notwithstanding that such supply may be an \\nexempt supply. \\n(3) A registered person making zero-rated supply shall be eligible to \\nclaim refund under either of the following options, namely:— \\n \\n(a) he may supply goods or services or both under bond or Letter of \\nUndertaking, subject to such conditions, safeguards and procedure as \\nmay be prescribed, without payment of integrated tax and claim \\nrefund of unutilized input tax credit; or \\n \\n(b) he may supply goods or services or both, subject to such conditions, \\nsafeguards and procedure as may be prescribed, on payment of \\nintegrated tax and claim refund of such tax paid on goods or services \\nor both supplied, in accordance with the provisions of section 54 of \\nthe Central Goods and Services Tax Act or the rules made \\nthereunder”. \\nSection 123 of the Finance Act, 2021 - Section 16(1)(b) of the IGST Act: \\nZero-rated supplies to SEZ for authorised operations The CBIC vide Notification \\nNo. 27/2023-CT, dated July 31, 2023 made the stated change, which will remove \\nthe ambiguity that only the supplies made for authorised operations to SEZ unit \\nor developer shall qualify as zero-rated supplies.

Export of Goods and Services to Nepal and Bhutan \\nExport of goods to Nepal or Bhutan fulfils the condition of GST Law \\nregarding taking goods out of India as per Section 2(5) of the IGST Act, 2017. \\nHence, export of goods to Nepal and Bhutan will be treated as zero-rated and \\nconsequently will also qualify for all the benefits available to zero-rated supplies \\nunder the GST regime irrespective of the fact that export realization is received \\nin Indian Currency. However, the definition of ‘export of services’ in terms of \\nSection 2(6)(iv) of the IGST Act, 2017 requires that the payment for such \\nservices should have been received by the supplier of services in convertible \\nforeign exchange. Hence, the payment received in India rupee shall not qualify \\nfor the export of services. \\nSection 54 has now been amended so that the supply of services to qualify as \\nexports, even if payment is received in Indian Rupees, where permitted by the \\nRBI with compliance to para 2.52 of the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020, \\nwherein it is clarified that exports proceeds from Nepal and Bhutan can be \\nrealized in Indian rupees. \\nThe Central Government vide Notification No. 42/2017-I.T. (Rate), dated \\n27th October, 2017 made the amendment in the Notification No. 9/2017-I.T. \\n(Rate), dated 28th June, 2017 whereby a new entry have been inserted in the \\nexemption notification, namely, Supply of services having place of supply in \\nNepal or Bhutan, against payment in Indian Rupees. \\nThough this great relief was provided to the service providers to these two \\ncountries by way of exemption from GST, a missing point is related to availment \\nof Input Tax Credit (ITC). If such services are exempted then ITC cannot be \\nclaimed. \\n5.1 Recommendations made by the GST Council in the 23rd meeting at \\nGuwahati on 10th November, 2017 \\nExports of services to Nepal and Bhutan have already been exempted from \\nGST. It has now been decided that such exporters will also be eligible for \\nclaiming Input Tax Credit in respect of goods or services used for effecting such \\nexempt supply of services to Nepal and Bhutan. \\nTherefore, Service to Nepal/Bhutan shall be treated as Export of Services \\nirrespective of realization of payment in Indian Rupee.

Thus \\nexporters must file their GSTR-1 very carefully to ensure that all relevant details \\nmatch. For their convenience, the details available in the Customs System have \\nbeen made available for viewing in their ICEGATE login. \\n(2) Exporters, who have not filed their GSTR-1 for month of July, 2017, \\nshall file immediately. \\n(3) For month of August, 2017 and subsequent months, facility of filing \\nGSTR-1 has not been made available by GSTN at present.

The \\nstatus of validation of bank account with PFMS is available in ICES. Exporters \\nmay be advised that if the account has not been validated by PFMS, they must \\nget their details corrected in the Customs system so that their bank account gets \\nvalidated by PFMS. \\n15. Processing of refund claims \\n(1) Proper officer of each jurisdiction shall generate a payment scroll of \\neligible IGST refunds in the same manner as RoSL scrolls are generated.

The exporters shall be \\nresponsible for procuring the seals at their own cost for use in self-\\nsealing. \\n \\n(b) Each seal be a one-time-bolt-seal bearing a unique serial number and \\nbrand of the vendor in the format ABCDXXXX XXXX, where ABCD \\nstands for the brand of the vendor and X 8 digit) is a numerical digit \\nfrom 0-9. \\n \\n(c) The RFID seal shall I confirm to ISO 17712:2013(H) and ISO/IEC \\n18000-6 Class 1 Gen 2 which is globally accepted in industrial \\napplications and can be read with the use of HUF (i.e. 860 MHz to 960 \\nMHz) Reader-Scanners. \\n \\n(d) The manufacturer or vendor, as the case may be, shall be in possession of \\ncertifications required for conformance of the ISO standard ISO \\n17712:2013 (H) namely, clause 4, 5 and 6. Before commencement of \\nsales, the vendor shall submit self-certified copies of the above \\ncertifications to the Risk Management Division (RMD) and all the \\nICDs/Ports where he intends to operate along with the unique series of \\nthe seals proposed to be offered for sale. \\n20. Application, Record keeping and Data Retrieval System \\nThe Circular No. 36/2017 has also modified the procedural norms that \\nexporters must follow to be able to use the new procedure, whose chief features \\nare as below: \\n \\n(a) It is clarified that the information sought from the exporter in para (vii) \\nof the Circular No. 26/2017-Cus. shall be read as : IEC (Importer',\n",
              " '800 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 33 \\nExporter Code), Shipping Bill Number, Shipping Bill date, e-seal \\nnumber, Date of sealing, Time of sealing, Destination Customs Station \\nfor export, Container Number, Trailer-Truck Number. It is further \\nclarified that the information need not be mounted “in the electronic \\nseal” but tagged to the seal using a ‘web/mobile application’ to be \\nprovided by the vendor of the RFID seals. Data once uploaded by the \\nexporter should not be capable of being overwritten or edited. \\n \\n(b) All vendors will be required to transmit information in para (a) above to \\nRMD and the respective destination ports/ICDs of export declared by the \\nexporter. The arrangements for transmission of data may be worked out \\nin consultation with the RMD and nodal Customs officer at each \\nICD/Port. \\n \\n(c) All vendors shall be required to make arrangements for reading/scanning \\nof RFID one-time-Bolt seals at the Customs ports ICDs at their own cost, \\nwhether through handheld readers or fixed readers. \\n \\n(d) The integrity of the RFID seal would be verified by the Customs officer \\nat the port/ICD by using the reader-scanners which are connected to Data \\nRetrieval System of the vendor. \\n \\n(e) Since all ICDs/ports where containerized cargo is handled would require \\nreader scanners, Principal Commissioners or Commissioners exercising \\nadministrative control over such ports/ICDs shall notify the details of the \\nnodal officers for the smooth operation of this system. \\n \\n(f) The transaction history of the self-sealing should be visible to the \\nexporters for their reference. \\n \\n(g) The vendor shall also undertake to integrate the information stored on the \\ndata retrieval server with ICEGATE at his own cost on a date and \\nmanner to be specified by the Directorate General of Systems, New \\nDelhi. \\nBoard has further announced that all vendors who propose to offer RFID \\nTamper Proof One-Time-Bolt Container Seals to exporters for self-sealing, must \\nsubmit self-attested Certificates from seal manufacturers to the CBEC before \\ncommencing sales. Where the certification is found to comply with the \\nrequirements of the ISO standard, the names of such vendors shall be put up on \\nthe Board’s website (www.cbec.gov.in) for ease of reference of the trade and field \\nformations. For the ease of reference of the exporters, vendors have been advised \\nto publicize on their website, the name of each port/ICD where they have \\nprovided readers. \\nConsidering the difficulties expressed by trade associations in locating \\nvendors of RFID seals, the Board has decided that the date for mandatory self-\\nsealing and use of RFID container seals will be deferred to 1st November, 2017. \\nThe earlier practice will continue till such time RFID seals are freely available to \\nexporters and they voluntarily adopt the new self-sealing procedure based on \\nRFID sealing.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 33 \\nExport Procedure under GST \\n801 \\nFurther, the Board vide its Circular No. 41/2017-Cus., dated 30th October, \\n2017 clarified that since exporters using RFID e-seals backed by application of \\ntechnology, while the progress made in the coverage of reader network across \\nports and ICDs is well recognized, but factoring that it may take some time for \\nthe field formations to fully set up systems and procedures to handling RFID e-\\nsealed containers as well as receipt of data, it has been decided that mandatory e-\\nsealing for different classes of exporters shall be brought in a phased manner as \\nindicated below: \\n(1) In respect of all exporters who have been permitted self-sealing facilities \\nunder erstwhile procedures and exporters who are AEO’s, it would be mandatory \\nto seal their export containers with prescribed RFID e-seal w.e.f. 8th Nov., 2017. \\nAny non-compliance will subject the containers to usual RMS parameters. \\n(2) In respect of the category of exporters who are availing supervised \\nstuffing at their premises, extent practice of supervised stuffing may continue till \\n19th November, 2017. With effect from 20th November, 2017, they shall have to \\nswitch to RFID e-sealing procedures. \\n(3) Regarding the exporters who have newly applied to the jurisdictional \\ncustoms authority for self-sealing permission under Circular 26/2017-Cus., dated \\n1st July, 2017, they shall commence use of the facility subject to grant of \\npermission and upon adoption of RFID e-sealing. \\n(4) The applicable date for RFID e-sealing implies that exporters are \\nrequired to use this procedure from the prescribed date. Any container sealed at \\nthe exporters premises before the prescribed date, shall not be required to brought \\nwith RFID e-seal. \\n(5) It is also clarified that those exporters who are in possession of RFID  \\ne-seals are at liberty commence availing the facilitative procedures forthwith. It \\nmay be recalled that vide Circular 37/2017-Cus., the e-sealing procedure had \\nbeen made voluntary subject to availability of reader facilities. \\n(6) As the RFID e-seal based self-sealing procedure has been introduce as a \\nmeasure of export facilitation, the field formations are advised to guide the \\nexporters and work closely with the private service providers for smooth rill-out \\nof the system. \\n(7) The procedures in respect of customs stations where readers have not \\nbeen provided by any vendor so far shall continue till 31st December, 2017, as \\nper existing practice, Board shall take necessary steps to make sure that the \\nreaders are made available at such customs stations by 1st January, 2018. \\nC.B.I. & C, vide Circular No. 88/07/2019-GST, dated 1st February, 2019 has \\namended the Circular No. 8/8/2017 dated 04.10.2017, in view of the amendment \\ncarried out in section 2(6) of the IGST Act, 2017 vide section 2 of the IGST \\n(Amendment) Act, 2018 as under: \\nAmended Para 2(k):  \\nRealization of export proceeds in Indian Rupee: Attention is invited to para \\nA (v) Part- I of RBI Master Circular No. 14/2015-16, dated 01st July, 2015',\n",

Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to expedite the verification for \\nIGST refunds \\nSeveral cases of monetisation of credit fraudulently obtained or ineligible \\ncredit through refund of Integrated Goods & Service Tax (IGST) on exports of \\ngoods have been detected in past few months. On verification, several such \\nexporters were found to be non-existent in a number of cases. In all these cases it \\nhas been found that the Input Tax Credit (ITC) was taken by the exporters on the \\nbasis of fake invoices and IGST on exports was paid using such ITC.  \\nTo mitigate the risk, the Board has taken measures to apply stringent risk \\nparameters-based checks driven by rigorous data analytics and Artificial \\nIntelligence tools based on which certain exporters are taken up for further \\nverification. Overall, in a broader time frame the percentage of such exporters \\nselected for verification is a small fraction of the total number of exporters \\nclaiming refunds. The refund scrolls in such cases are kept in abeyance till the \\nverification report in respect of such cases is received from the field formations. \\nFurther, the export consignments/shipments of concerned exporters are subjected \\nto 100 % examination at the customs port.  \\nWhile the verifications are caused to mitigate risk, it is necessary that \\ngenuine exporters do not face any hardship. In this context it is advised that \\nexporters whose scrolls have been kept in abeyance for verification would be \\ninformed at the earliest possible either by the jurisdictional CGST or by Customs. \\nTo expedite the verification, the exporters on being informed in this regard or on\",\n",

In other words, any supply of services \\nby an establishment of a foreign company in India to any other establishment of \\nthe said foreign company outside India will not be covered under definition of \\nexport of services.  \\n4.2 Further, perusal of the Explanation 2 to section 8 of the IGST Act \\nsuggests that if a foreign company is conducting business in India through a \\nbranch or an agency or a representational office, then the said branch or agency \\nor representational office of the foreign company, located in India, shall be \\ntreated as establishment of the said foreign company in India. Similarly, if any \\ncompany incorporated in India, is operating through a branch or an agency or a \\nrepresentational office in any country outside India, then that branch or agency or \\nrepresentational office shall be treated as the establishment of the said company \\nin the said country \\n4.3 In view of the above, it can be stated that supply of services made by a \\nbranch or an agency or representational office of a foreign company, not \\nincorporated in India, to any establishment of the said foreign company outside \\nIndia, shall be treated as supply between establishments of distinct persons and \\nshall not be considered as “export of services” in view of condition (v) of sub-\\nsection (6) of section 2 of IGST Act. Similarly, any supply of service by a \\ncompany incorporated in India to its branch or agency or representational office, \\nlocated in any other country and not incorporated under the laws of the said \\ncountry, shall also be considered as supply between establishments of distinct \\npersons and cannot be treated as export of services. \\n4.4 From the perusal of the definition of “person” under sub-section (84) of \\nsection 2 of the CGST Act, 2017 and the definitions of “company” and “foreign',\n",
              " 'Chap. 33 \\nExport Procedure under GST \\n811 \\ncompany” under Section 2 of the Companies Act, 2013, it is observed that a \\ncompany incorporated in India and a foreign company incorporated outside \\nIndia, are separate “person” under the provisions of CGST Act and accordingly, \\nare separate legal entities. Thus, a subsidiary/sister concern/group concern of any \\nforeign company which is incorporated in India, then the said company \\nincorporated in India will be considered as a separate “person” under the \\nprovisions of CGST Act and accordingly, would be considered as a separate legal \\nentity than the foreign company \\nClarification \\n5.1 In view of the above, it is clarified that a company incorporated in India \\nand a body corporate incorporated by or under the laws of a country outside \\nIndia, which is also referred to as foreign company under Companies Act, are \\nseparate persons under CGST Act, and thus are separate legal entities. \\nAccordingly, these two separate persons would not be considered as “merely \\nestablishments of a distinct person in accordance with Explanation 1 in section \\n8”. \\n5.2 Therefore, supply of services by a subsidiary/sister concern/group \\nconcern, etc. of a foreign company, which is incorporated in India under the \\nCompanies Act, 2013 (and thus qualifies as a ‘company’ in India as per \\nCompanies Act), to the establishments of the said foreign company located \\noutside India (incorporated outside India), would not be barred by the condition \\n(v) of the sub-section (6) of the section 2 of the IGST Act 2017 for being \\nconsidered as export of services, as it would not be treated as supply between \\nmerely establishments of distinct persons under Explanation 1 of section 8 of \\nIGST Act 2017 . Similarly, the supply from a company incorporated in India to \\nits related establishments outside India, which are incorporated under the laws \\noutside India, would not be treated as supply to merely establishments of distinct \\nperson under Explanation 1 of section 8 of IGST Act 2017. Such supplies, \\ntherefore, would qualify as ‘export of services’, subject to fulfilment of other \\nconditions as provided under sub-section (6) of section 2 of IGST Act. \\n25.

Case Law \\nSale of goods from Duty free shops located at International Airports \\nconstitutes ‘export’: \\n[Sandeep Patil v Union of India reported in 2019(31) G.S.T.L.398 (Bom)] \\nThe assessee sells goods to international passengers from duty free shops \\n(DFS) situated in international airport at Mumbai. Such goods are mainly \\nimported or procured from SEZ units in India and are sold before they cross \\ncustoms barrier. The assessee had challenged the order passed by the Dy. \\nCommissioner denying the refund of ITC on accumulated on account of services \\nreceived by duty free shops at the airport. \\nThe High Court observed that export means ‘taking goods out of India to a \\nplace outside India’. Supply by assessee from DFS to the outbound passenger \\nconstitutes export. Warehoused goods supplied before clearance for home \\nconsumption is neither supply of goods nor supply of services. Sales from DFS to \\narriving passengers are sales from the customs area as the goods have neither \\ncrossed customs frontier nor cleared for home consumption by DFS and, hence, \\ncustoms duty and IGST are not payable by DFS. The High Court, thus, sets aside \\nthe order passed by the Dy. Commissioner and held that the sale of goods from \\nDFS located at International Airports constitutes ‘export of goods’ and, hence, \\nassessee is entitled to get refund of input tax credit. \\n* \\n* \\n* \\nAccommodation services provided to SEZ units are to be treated as ‘zero \\nrated supplies’: Advance Ruling Authority –GST. \\n[Carnation Hotels (P.)

If the hotel or accommodation services \\nare received by SEZ developer or SEZ unit for authorized operations, as \\nendorsed by the specified officer of the zone, the benefit of zero rated supply \\nshall be available to the supplier.

The revenue authorities held that applicant was not entitled to refund of \\nIGST paid on goods exported as it had availed of higher duty drawback in respect \\nof those goods. The applicant had filed writ petition to sought sanction of refund \\nof IGST paid for exported goods. \\nThe High Court observed that as per the CGST Rules, 2017 shipping bill \\nfiled by the assessee would deemed to be refund application of IGST paid for \\ngoods exported out of India. Further, refund could be withheld only when request \\nwas received by the jurisdictional Commissioner regarding the same or when the \\ngoods were exported in violation of the Customs Act, 1962 as determined by \\nproper officer of Customs. There was neither any provision nor any circular or \\ninstruction under GST law which would restrict IGST refund for reason that \\nhigher rate of drawback was claimed.

Meaning of Works Contract Service \\nThe treatment and taxability of “Works Contract Service” has been a matter \\nof litigation in the pre-GST era. The activities of works contract involve a \\ncomposite supply of both goods and services. A works contract service relates to \\nboth immovable and movable property is undertaken to execute a contract. Even \\nthough the concept of ‘works contract’ has been incorporated under GST but it is \\nlimited to immovable property only.  \\n2. Works Contract in the GST regime  \\nThe provision of ‘works contract’ has been restricted to any work undertaken \\nfor an “Immovable Property” and works contract for movable property is not \\nunder scope of GST. \\n3. Definition of works contract service \\nSection 2(119) of the CGST Act, 2017 defines “works contract” means a \\ncontract for building, construction, fabrication, completion, erection, installation, \\nfitting out, improvement, modification, repair, maintenance, renovation, \\nalteration or commissioning of any immovable property wherein transfer of \\nproperty in goods (whether as goods or in some other form) is involved in the \\nexecution of such contract.” \\nThe plain reading of the above definition, it is clarified that works contract \\nhas been confined to contract for construction of building, fabrication, erection, \\nfitting out etc. of any immovable property only. Further, the supply of goods \\nundertaken for fabrication, modification, renovation, Alternation, fitting out or \\npaint job where as such supply qualifies as composite supplies unlike earlier tax \\nregime, but will not be treated as a Works Contract for the purposes of GST.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 36 \\nWorks Contract Service \\n831 \\nAs per entry No. 5(b) of schedule II to the CGST Act, 2017, construction of a \\ncomplex, building, civil structure or a part thereof, including a complex or \\nbuilding intended for sale to a buyer, wholly or partly, except where the entire \\nconsideration has been received after issuance of completion certificate, where \\nrequired, by the competent authority or after its first occupation, whichever is \\nearlier. \\nThus it is ample clear that works contract in relation to civil construction of \\nbuilding, complex or any civil structure is treated as supply of service if it is sold \\nbefore completion of construction. However, if entire consideration on works \\ncontract has been received after issuance of completion certificate issued by the \\ncompetent authority or before its first occupation, whichever is earlier then no \\nGST is leviable on such supply as this become immovable property and GST \\ncan’t be levied on sale of immovable property. \\nFurther, as per entry No. 6(a) of Schedule II to the CGST Act, 2017, works \\ncontracts as defined in Section 2(119) of the CGST Act, 2017 (composite supply \\nof goods and services) shall be treated as a supply of services. This provision has \\nbeen clarified in Section 7(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 (Scope of supply for levy of \\ntax). GST law has clearly clarified the tax liability of works contract. Thereby, \\nthis implies works contract will be treated as service and tax would be charged \\naccordingly. This clarity on provision of works contract as service and not as \\nsupply of goods. \\n4.

Place of Supply in respect of Works Contract \\nWorks Contract under GST would necessarily involve immovable property. \\nIn view of the same the place of supply would be governed by Section 12(3) of \\nthe IGST Act, 2017, where both the supplier and recipient are located in India. \\nThe place of supply would be where the immovable property is located. \\nIn case the immovable property is located outside India, and the supplier as \\nwell as recipient both are located in India, the place of supply would be the \\nlocation of recipient as per proviso to Section 12(3) of the IGST Act, 2017. \\nAs per Section 13(4) of the IGST Act, 2017, in cases where either the \\nSupplier or the Recipient are located outside India, the place of supply shall be \\nthe place where the immovable property is located or intended to be located. \\n7. Maintenance of records \\nAs per Rule 56(14) of the CGST Rules, 2017, every registered person \\nexecuting works contract shall keep separate accounts for works contract \\nshowing— \\n \\n(a) the names and addresses of the persons on whose behalf the works \\ncontract is executed;  \\n \\n(b) description, value and quantity (wherever applicable) of goods or \\nservices received for the execution of works contract; \\n \\n(c) description, value and quantity (wherever applicable) of goods or \\nservices utilized in the execution of works contract;  \\n \\n(d)  the details of payment received in respect of each works contract; and  \\n \\n(e)  the names and addresses of suppliers from whom he received goods or \\nservices. \\n8. Input Tax Credit (ITC) \\nAs per Section 17(5)(c) of the CGST Act, 2017, input tax credit shall not be \\navailable in respect of the works contract services when supplied for construction \\nof an immovable property (other than plant and machinery) except where it is an \\ninput service for further supply of works contract service.',\n",
              " '838 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 36 \\nThus, ITC for works contract can be availed only by one who is in the same \\nline of business and is using such services received for further supply of works \\ncontract service. For example a building developer may engage services of a \\nsubcontractor for certain portion of the whole work. The subcontractor will \\ncharge GST in the tax invoice raised on the main contractor. The main contractor \\nwill be entitled to take ITC on the tax invoice raised by his sub-contractor as his \\noutput is works contract service. However if the main contractor provides works \\ncontract service (other than for plant and machinery) to a company say in the IT \\nbusiness, the ITC of GST paid on the invoice raised by the works contractor will \\nnot be available to the IT Company. \\nPlant and Machinery in certain cases when affixed permanently to the earth \\nwould constitute immovable property. When a works contract is for the \\nconstruction of plant and machinery, the ITC of the tax paid to the works \\ncontractor would be available to the recipient, whatever is the business of the \\nrecipient. This is because works contract in respect of plant and machinery comes \\nwithin the exclusion clause of the negative list and ITC would be available when \\nWorks Contract in GST used in the course or furtherance of business. \\nHence, Input Tax Credit shall not be available for any work contract services. \\nITC for the construction of an immovable property cannot be availed, except \\nwhere the input service is used for further work contract services. \\nFurther, No ITC is available for goods/services for construction of an \\nimmovable property on his own account. Even if such goods/services are used in \\nthe course or furtherance of business, ITC will not be available. \\nBut this rule does not apply to plant or machinery. ITC is available on inputs \\nused to manufacture plant and machinery for own use. \\nExample— \\nAjay Steel Industries constructs an office building for its headquarters. ITC \\nwill not be available. \\nAjay Steel Industries also constructs a blast furnace to manufacture steel. \\nITC is available since it is a plant. \\nWith the introduction of GST in India, litigation on account of treatment of \\n‘works contract’ comes to an end. In pre-GST era the same works contract was \\nsubject levy of tax by both Central Government (on service component of a \\nworks contract) and State Government (on sale of goods portion execution of \\nworks contract). But the GST law has clarified that a works contract is supply of \\nservices as per Entry No. 5(b) and 6(a) of Schedule-II to the CGST Act, 2017. \\nGST law has made it clear that a works contract as a supply of service and \\nspecified a uniform rate of tax applicable on same value across India. With this \\nclarity on ‘works contract’ tax system will be simpler and litigation free. \\n9.

(Rate), Sr. No. 11, (ii) also provides \\nthat supporting services in transport other than those mentioned in (i) (Heading \\n9967) would attract GST @9% CGST. Identical rate would be applicable for \\nSGST also, taking the effective rate to 18%. Similar rate has been prescribed for \\nservices falling under heading No.9965 in terms of Notification No. 11/2017-\\nC.T. (Rate), Sr. No. 9(v). \\n6. ITC on GTA Services \\nThe recipient of GTA services is liable to discharge tax under reverse charge \\nbasis under GST and is entitled to take Input Tax Credit (ITC) of the amount of \\ntax paid by him, provided it is to be used in the course or furtherance of business \\nat his end. Further the recipient would be eligible for ITC of the GST paid by \\nGTA on forward charge basis. \\n7. Liability to Pay GST on GTA services  \\nGenerally, the supplier of service is required to assess his tax liability and \\ndischarge tax. But in the case of GTA services the recipient for supply of services \\nby a Goods Transport Agency (GTA) who has not paid Central tax at the rate of \\n6% in respect of transportation of goods by road, recipient of such services is \\nrequired to assess and pay tax liabilities under reverse charge basis. In terms of \\nNotification No. 13/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated 28-6-2017 (Sr. No. 1) as amended \\nby Notification No. 22/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated 22-8-2017, if the recipients \\n(located in the taxable territory), the following category of persons to discharge \\nthe tax liabilities under  \\n8. GTA services liability under Reverse Charge Mechanism  \\n \\n(a) Any factory registered under or governed by the Factories Act, 1948 963 \\nof 1948); or any society registered under the Societies Registration Act, \\n1860 (21 of 1860) or under any other law for the time being in force in \\nany part of India; or  \\n \\n(b) any co-operative society established by or under any law; or \\n \\n(c) any person registered under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act or \\nthe Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act or the State Goods and \\nServices Tax Act or the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Act; or \\n \\n(d) anybody corporate established, by or under any law; or \\n \\n(e) any partnership firm whether registered or not under any law including \\nassociation of persons; or \\n \\n(f) any casual taxable person.',\n",
              " '844 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 37 \\nTherefore, in the cases where services of GTA are availed by the above \\ncategories of persons in the taxable territory the GTA suppler has the option to \\npay tax (and avail ITC) @12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST); and if the GTA does not \\navail this option, the liability to pay GST will fall on the recipients. In all other \\ncases where the recipients do not fall in the categories mentioned above, the \\nliability will be on the supplier of GTA services.  \\n9. Place of Supply for GTA under GST  \\nThe place of Origin and place of supply having important roles to ascertain \\ntax liability one has to discharge under GST. In terms of Section 12(8) of the \\nIGST Act, 2017, the place of supply of services by way of transportation of \\ngoods, including by mail or courier to— \\n \\n(a) a registered person, shall be the location of such person;  \\n \\n(b) a person other than a registered person, shall be the location at which \\nsuch goods are handed over for their transportation. \\n10. Registration by GTA  \\nThere is no specific provision for registration by GTA under GST, if all the \\nservices of the GTA fall under Reverse Charge Mechanism then a GTA is not \\nrequired to register and therefore there is no obligation to comply the provision \\nof GST. Even if he is engaged exclusively transporting goods, wherein turnover \\nexceeds `20 lakhs as the total tax is required to be paid by the recipient under \\nreverse charge basis, a GTA does not have to register under GST.  \\nTo sum up, the provision of GTA was prevailing under the erstwhile Service \\nTax regime has been carried forward in to the GST law. The Goods Transport \\nAgency neither requires to take registration or discharge tax liability of services \\nsupplied by them under GST regime except in exceptional cases not covered by \\nNo. 13/2017 as amended. To attract liability of GST, a GTA must necessarily \\nissue consignment note against transporting of goods by road. In other words, \\nonly those transport services provided by a GTA are taxable under GST wherein \\ngoods transportation is covered under the consignment note. The GST law \\nrecognizes that pure transportation of goods services are mostly provided by \\npersons in the unorganized sector and such operators specifically been excluded \\nfrom the tax net. In respect of those who provide agency services in transport, the \\nliability is cast on the recipients in most of the cases or unless option to pay under \\nforward charge basis has been exercised by the GTA. \\n11. Goods Transport Agency (GTA) under RCM and Forward Charge \\nImportant amendment for Goods Transport Agency (GTA) under \\nReverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) and Forward Charge Basis option. \\nAs per recommendation of 47th GST Council Meeting, the Government has \\nnotified on 13-07-2022 the changes option provided to Goods Transport Agency \\n(GTA) under RCM and Forward charge for discharging GST liabilities against \\nservices provided to the clients.',\n",

Introduction \\nEducation is the back bone of a Country’s prosperity and growth of its \\neconomy. To generate Skill in our human resources there is a need of better \\nschooling with quality training for the young generations in the Country. \\nAccordingly, the Government has been allotting a substantial amount of funds in \\nthe every year’s Finance budget for education, Skill development and vocational \\ntraining programme. So, the Government ensures “Free and Compulsory \\nEducation to all Children” guaranteed in Article 21A of the chapter of \\nFundamental Right in the Indian Constitution. \\n2. Tax provisions on Education sector under pre-GST era  \\nIn the Service Tax regime, services relating to education sectors were \\nincluded in the negative list of Service Tax. But only the following specified \\neducation Services were exempted from the payment of Service Tax: \\n\\uf0b7 \\npre-school education and education up to higher secondary school or \\nequivalent; \\n\\uf0b7 \\neducation as part of a prescribed curriculum for obtaining a qualification \\nrecognized by law for the time being in force; and \\n\\uf0b7 \\neducation as a part of an approved vocational education course.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 38 \\nGST on Education Sectors \\n851 \\nWith regard to meaning of ‘education as a part of curriculum for obtaining a \\nqualification recognized by law’ was clearly explained in para 4.12.1 of Taxation \\nof Services: An Education Guide issued by C.B.E. & C., w.e.f 1-7-2012, the \\nrelevant para is reproduced as under:— \\n“It means that only such educational services are in the negative list as \\nare related to delivery of education as ‘a part’ of the curriculum that has been \\nprescribed for obtaining a qualification prescribed by law. It is important to \\nunderstand that to be in the negative list the service should be delivered as \\npart of curriculum. Conduct of degree courses by college, universities or \\ninstitutions which lead grant of qualifications recognized by law would be \\ncovered. Training given by private coaching institutions would not be \\ncovered as such training does not lead to grant of a recognized qualification”.  \\n3. Tax provisions on Education Sector in the GST regime \\nThe Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 nowhere defines the meaning \\nof Education. \\nThe Supreme Court in its decision in the case of “Loka Shikshana Trust v \\nCommissioner of Income Tax” has defined Education as the “Process of training \\nand developing knowledge, skill and character of students by normal schooling” \\nIt is necessary that the role of any school or educational institution extends to \\nteach good character and other skills and not restrict by providing only the \\ntechnical education. \\n4. Responsibility of the Government  \\nEducation is listed under the Concurrent list wherein both the Centre and \\nStates are jointly responsible for all promotional measures relating to education \\nhave to be taken by both the Central Government and State Government. Article \\n21A of Constitution of India binds the State to provide for free and compulsory \\neducation of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a \\nFundamental right in such manner as the State or Centre may determines their \\npolicies. \\n5. Requirement of Taxing Education Sector  \\nWhile the basic and elementary education is a Constitutional right, but in \\nrealty the present scenario, where education sector has turned into \\ncommercialization just like a business profession. So the Government has \\nrestricted its policy to give blanket exemption to all education institutions and \\nfixed exemption to certain categories to end up profiteering activities and \\nimposed tax on certain categories of education sectors.  \\n6. Taxability of Education in the GST-regime  \\nThe education services provided by the institutions and providing the \\nfollowing are fully exempted: \\n1. Pre-school to Higher Secondary School  \\n2. Qualifications recognized by Indian law \\n3. Approved vocational educational course',\n",
              " '852 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 38 \\nIt is important to note that core education services with respect to school \\neducation irrespective of whether it is recognized by Indian law or not is exempt. \\nFor instance, Services provided by international schools giving international \\ncertifications such as International Baccalaureate (IB) is exempt. \\nThe requirement of the qualification being recognized by Indian law arises \\nonly after school education. Hence, if a college course leads to a qualification not \\nrecognized by Indian law, the fees received by the college in that respect is fully \\ntaxable. \\n7. Exemption on entrance fees \\nEducational Institutions also provide support services in addition to the core \\neducational services. Such support services either are in addition to or aid to the \\ncore educational services provided by such institutions.

Conduct of degree courses by colleges, universities or institutions \\nwhich lead grant of qualifications recognized by law would be covered. Training \\ngiven by private coaching institutes would not be covered as such training does \\nnot lead to grant of a recognized qualification. \\nAre services provided by way of education as a part of a prescribed curriculum \\nfor obtaining a qualification recognized by a law of a foreign country covered \\nin the negative list entry? \\nNo. To be covered in the negative list a course should be recognized by an \\nIndian law. \\nWithin the term “educational institution”, sub-clause (iii) covers institutions \\nproviding services by way of education as a part of approved vocational course, \\nand institutions providing the above courses will come within the ambit of the \\nterm educational institution.

              " '858 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 38 \\nAn “approved vocational education course” means,— \\n \\n(i) a course run by an industrial training institute or an industrial training \\ncentre affiliated to the National Council for Vocational Training or State \\nCouncil for Vocational Training offering courses in designated trades \\nnotified under the Apprentices Act, 1961 (52 of 1961); or \\n \\n(ii) a Modular Employable Skill Course, approved by the National Council \\nof Vocational Training, run by a per son registered with the Directorate \\nGeneral \\nof \\nTraining, \\nMinistry \\nof \\nSkill \\nDevelopment \\nand \\nEntrepreneurship.  \\nIt is to be noted that only those institutions whose operations conform to the \\nspecifics given in the definition of the term “Educational Institution”, would be \\ntreated as one and entitled to avail exemptions provided by the law. This would \\nmean that private coaching centres or other unrecognized institutions, though \\nself-styled as educational institutions, would not be treated as educational \\ninstitutions under GST and thus cannot avail exemptions available to an \\neducational institution. \\nThus, educational institutions up to Higher Secondary School level do not \\nsuffer GST on output services and also on most of the important input services. \\nSome of the input services like canteen, repairs and maintenance etc. provided by \\nprivate players to educational institutions were subject to service tax in pre-GST \\nera and the same tax treatment has been continued in GST regime. \\nThus output services of lodging/boarding in hostels provided by such \\neducational institutions which are providing preschool education and education \\nup to higher secondary school or equivalent or education leading to a \\nqualification recognized by law, are fully exempt from GST. Annual \\nsubscription/fees charged as lodging/boarding charges by such educational \\ninstitutions from its students for hostel accommodation shall therefore, not attract \\nGST. \\nSimilarly, output services related to the specified courses provided by IIM’s \\nwould be exempt. Executive Development Programs run by the IIM’s are \\nspecifically excluded, hence such courses would be subject to GST. \\nRegarding, input services, it may be noted that where output services are \\nexempted, the Educational institutions may not be able to avail credit of tax paid \\non the input side.

Such services are exempt only for educational \\ninstitutions providing services by way of education up to higher secondary or \\nequivalent, (from pre-school to HSC).

Composite and Mixed Supply insofar as Education is concerned  \\nBoarding schools provide service of education coupled with other services \\nlike providing dwelling units for residence and food. This may be a case of \\nbundled services if the charges for education and lodging and boarding are \\ninseparable. Their taxability will be determined in terms of the principles laid \\ndown in section 2(30) read with section 8 of the CGST Act, 2017. Such services \\nin the case of boarding schools are naturally bundled and supplied in the ordinary \\ncourse of business. Therefore, the bundle of services will be treated as consisting \\nentirely of the principal supply, which means the service which forms the \\npredominant element of such a bundle. In this case since the predominant nature \\nis determined by the service of education, the other service of providing \\nresidential dwelling will not be considered for the purpose of determining the tax \\nliability and in this case the entire consideration for the supply will be exempt. \\nLet’s take another example where a course in a college leads to dual \\nqualification only one of which is recognized by law. Would service provided by \\nthe college by way of such education be covered by the exemption notification? \\nProvision of dual qualifications is in the nature of two separate services as the \\ncurriculum and fees for each of such qualifications are prescribed separately. \\nService in respect of each qualification would, therefore, be assessed separately. \\nIf an artificial bundle of service is created by clubbing two courses together, \\nonly one of which leads to a qualification recognized by law, then by application \\nof the rule of determination of taxability of a supply which is not bundled in the \\nordinary course of business, it shall be treated as a mixed supply as per \\nprovisions contained in section 2(74) read with section 8 of the CGST Act, 2017. \\nThe taxability will be determined by the supply which attracts highest rate of \\nGST. \\nHowever incidental auxiliary courses provided by way of hobby classes or \\nextra-curricular activities in furtherance of overall well-being will be an example \\nof naturally bundled course, and therefore treated as composite supply one \\nrelevant consideration in such cases will be the amount of extra billing being \\ndone for the unrecognized component viz-a-viz the recognized course. If extra \\nbilling is being done, it may be a case of artificial bundling of two different \\nsupplies, not supplied together in the ordinary course of business, and therefore \\nwill be treated as a mixed supply, attracting the rate of the higher taxed \\ncomponent for the entire consideration. \\nThe Education guide of 2012 for the purpose of service tax has given the \\nfollowing important clarifications in respect of educational services. The same \\ncan be gainfully referred to, for the purpose of clarity under the GST regime: \\n“The supply of placement services provided to educational institutions \\nfor securing job placements for the students shall be liable to service tax. \\nSimilarly, educational institutes such as IITs, IIMs charge a fee from',\n",
              " 'Chap. 38 \\nGST on Education Sectors \\n861 \\nprospective employers like corporate houses/MNCs, who come to the \\ninstitutes for recruiting candidates through campus interviews in relation to \\ncampus recruitments. Such services shall also be liable to service tax.” \\n16. Applicability of GST on various fees \\nApplicability of GST on application fee charged for entrance or the fee \\ncharged for issuance of eligibility certificate for admission or for issuance of \\nmigration certificate by educational institutions: \\nIt is stated that educational services supplied by educational institutions to its \\nstudents are exempt from GST vide entry 66 of the notification No. 12/2017 \\nCentral Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017 relevant portion of which reads as under, \\n“Services provided— \\n(a)  \\nby an educational institution to its students, faculty and staff; \\n[(aa) by an educational institution by way of conduct of entrance \\nexamination against consideration in the form of entrance fee;]...” \\nTherefore, it can be seen that all services supplied by an ‘educational \\ninstitution’ to its students are exempt from GST. Consideration charged by the \\neducational institutes by way of entrance fee for conduct of entrance examination \\nis also exempt. The exemption is wide enough to cover the amount or fee \\ncharged for admission or entrance, or amount charged for application fee for \\nentrance, or the fee charged from prospective students for issuance of eligibility \\ncertificate to them in the process of their entrance/admission to the educational \\ninstitution. Services supplied by an educational institution by way of issuance of \\nmigration certificate to the leaving or ex-students are also covered by the \\nexemption. Accordingly, such activities of educational institution are also \\nexempt.  \\nAccordingly, it is clarified that the amount or fee charged from prospective \\nstudents for entrance or admission, or for issuance of eligibility certificate to \\nthem in the process of their entrance/admission as well as the fee charged for \\nissuance of migration certificates by educational institutions to the leaving or ex-\\nstudents is covered by exemption under Sl.

Advance Rulings \\n865 \\n \\n1. Meaning of Pure Agent \\nGenerally, speaking agent means a person who plays role of intermediary to \\nfacilitate business between two parties or to arrange goods or services for his \\nclient procuring from another person. An agent gets commission or brokerage \\namount on requirement order of his client. The concept of pure agent was also \\navailable under Service Tax law. A pure agent concept was borrowed from the \\nerstwhile Service Tax Determination of Value Rules, 2006 and the same \\nprovision incorporated under GST law. \\n2. Pure Agent concept in pre-GST era \\nPure agent has been defined in Explanation to sub-rule 2 of Rule (5) of the \\nValuation Rules as a person who:— \\n\\uf0b7 \\nenters into a contractual agreement with the recipient of service to act as \\nhis pure agent to incur expenditure or costs in the course of providing \\ntaxable service; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nneither intends to hold nor holds any title to the goods or services so \\nprocured or provided as pure agent of the recipient of service; \\n\\uf0b7 \\ndoes not use such goods or services so procured; and \\n\\uf0b7 \\nreceives only the actual amount incurred to procure such goods or \\nservices. \\n3. Pure Agent concept in the GST regime \\nSection 2(5) of the CGST Act, 2017 defines “agent” means a person, \\nincluding a factor, broker, commission agent, arhatia, del credere agent, an \\nauctioneer or any other mercantile agent, by whatever name called, who carries \\non the business of supply or receipt of goods or services or both on behalf of \\nanother;',\n",
              " 'Chap. 39 \\nPure Agent Services \\n863 \\nThus, the GST Act defines an Agent as a person including a factor, broker, \\ncommission agent, agent, arhatia, del credere agent, an auctioneer or any other \\nmercantile agent, by whatever name called, who carries on the business of supply \\nor receipt of goods or services or both on behalf of another. \\nBroadly speaking, a pure agent is one who while making a supply to the \\nrecipient, also receives and incurs expenditure on some other supply on behalf of \\nthe recipient and claims reimbursements (as actual, without adding it to the value \\nof his own supply) for such supplies from the recipient of the main supply. While \\nthe relationship between them (provider of service and recipient of service) in \\nrespect of the main service is on a principal to principal basis, the relationship \\nbetween them in respect of other ancillary services is that of a pure agent. \\n4. Relevance of Pure Agent under GST \\nThe concept of pure agent has been explained in Rule 33 of the CGST Rules, \\n2017 of Chapter IV of Determination of Value of Supply and a pure agent \\nexpression meaning as follows:— \\nA “pure agent” means a person who: \\n \\n(a) enters into a contractual agreement with the recipient of supply to act as \\nhis pure agent to incur expenditure or costs in the course of supply of \\ngoods or services or both; \\n \\n(b) neither intends to hold nor holds any title to the goods or services or both \\nso procured or supplied as pure agent of the recipient of supply; \\n \\n(c) does not use for his own interest such goods or services procured; and \\n \\n(d) receives only the actual amount incurred to procure such goods or \\nservices in addition to the amount received for supply he provides on his \\nown account. \\nThus important thing to note is that a pure agent does not use the goods or \\nservices so procured for his own interest and this fact has to be determined from \\nthe terms of the contract. \\nSimple speaking, pure agent is a person who makes a supply of goods and \\nservices to the recipient. He undertakes to receive ancillary services from other \\nsuppliers of goods or services and incurs expenditure on behalf of his client. On \\ndelivering of goods or services to the client he claimed the actual expenditures as \\nreimbursement. \\n5. Illustration of Pure Agent \\nThe Pure agent situation can be explained in the following example \\nIllustration: A is an importer and B is a custom broker. A approaches B for \\ncustom clearance of import consignment and delivery thereof, which require a \\ntransportation facility to be provided to B. So, A authorizes B to procure service \\nof transportation and agreed to reimburse the actual amount which would be \\nincurred for such procurement of transportation service. B provides the custom \\nbroker service and paid to the transporter on behalf of A for the delivery of goods \\nso cleared. There is a contractual agreement between A & B to incur the',\n",
              " '864 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 39 \\nexpenditure in the course of supply of his Customs Broker Service and the \\nagreement provides reimbursement of transport services utilised at actual. B will \\nreceive the actual amount which was paid by him to transporter. The ancillary \\nservice of transportation provided by B is on pure agent basis; the value of \\ntransportation service claimed as reimbursement and will not be part of taxable \\nvalue of Customs Broker service. \\n6. Exclusion from value of supply for levy of GST \\nThe GST law provides that expenditure incurred as pure agent becomes \\nrelevant for of the determination of the value of a supply for levy of GST. Thus, \\nthe valuation rules provide that expenditure incurred as pure agent, will be \\nexcluded from the value of supply and also from aggregate turnover. However, \\nsuch exclusion of expenditure incurred as pure agent is possible only and only if \\nall the conditions required to be considered as a pure agent and further conditions \\nstipulated in the rules are satisfied by the supplier in each case. \\nAs per Rule 33 of the CGST Rules, 2017 as prescribed that the expenditure \\nor costs incurred by a supplier as a pure agent of the recipient of supply shall be \\nexcluded from the value of supply, if all the following conditions are satisfied, \\nnamely:— \\n \\n(i) the supplier acts as a pure agent of the recipient of the supply, when he \\nmakes the payment to the third party on authorisation by such recipient; \\n \\n(ii) the payment made by the pure agent on behalf of the recipient of supply \\nhas been separately indicated in the invoice issued by the pure agent to \\nthe recipient of service; and \\n (iii) the supplies procured by the pure agent from the third party as a pure \\nagent of the recipient of supply are in addition to the services he supplies \\non his own account. \\nIn case the above conditions are not satisfied, such expenditure incurred shall \\nbe included in the value of supply under GST. \\n7. Illustration of exclusion from value of supply \\nThe exclusion from value can be explained in the following example \\nIllustration: Corporate services firm, A is engaged to handle the legal work \\npertaining to the incorporation of Company B. Other than its service fees, A also \\nrecovers from B, registration fee and approval fee for the name of the company \\npaid to the Registrar of Companies. The fees charged by the Registrar of \\nCompanies for the registration and approval of the name are compulsorily levied \\non B. A is merely acting as a pure agent in the payment of those fees. Therefore, \\nA’s recovery of such expenses is a disbursement and not part of the value of \\nsupply made by A to B. \\n8. Examples of pure agent expenditures: \\n1. Port fees, Port Charges, Custom duty, dock dues, transport charges etc. \\npaid by Customs Broker on behalf of owner of imported goods.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 39 \\nPure Agent Services \\n865 \\n2. Expenses incurred by C & F agent and reimbursed by principal such as \\nfreight, godown charges. \\nIllustration: \\nSuppose a Customs Broker issues an invoice for reimbursement of a few \\nexpenses and for consideration towards agency service rendered to an importer. \\nThe amounts charged by the Customs Broker are as below: \\nSl. No. \\nComponent Charged in invoice \\nAmount (`) \\n1 \\nAgency Income; \\n10,000/- \\n2 \\nTravelling expenses/Hotel expenses \\n15,000/- \\n3 \\nCustoms Duty \\n55,000/- \\n4 \\nDocks Dues \\n5,000/- \\nIn the above situation, agency income and travelling/hotel expenses shall be \\nadded for determining the value of supply by the Customs Broker whereas Docks \\ndues and Customs Duty shall not be added to value, provided the conditions of \\npure agent are satisfied. \\nIn nutshell, the concept of pure agent is not a new provision, which was \\navailable under Service Tax law and the same provision has incorporated under \\nGST. This topic clearly explained that the reimbursement expenditure paid by the \\nsupplier should not be considered as part of value for levy of GST and also while \\ncalculating the aggregate turnover for determination of threshold limit of \\nregistration, the expenditure incurred by the supplier for such expenses of pure \\nagent should be excluded. Therefore, any person who wishes to act as pure agent \\nshall ensure to satisfy the conditions as specified under Rule 33 of CGST Rules, \\nso that value of services so supplied by him is not subject to GST. The concept of \\npure agent has direct implications on the value of taxable supply and it affects the \\namount of GST charged on a particular supply if he fails to satisfy the conditions \\nso specified under Valuation Rules. If he satisfies the stipulated conditions \\nprovided under valuation rules, he will be qualified as a pure agent under GST. \\n9. Advance Rulings \\nIn Re: Cigma Medical Coding Private Ltd, reported in 2021 (53) G.S.T.L. 51 \\n(A.A.R. - GST - Ker.), held that “the students are not enrolled with the applicant \\nfor training but have approached the applicant for facilitating payment of fees to \\nAAPC for procuring the examination and certification services provided by \\nAAPC.

The applicant \\nreceives the required amount and the same amount is transferred to the \\nInstitutions and/or Principal Investigators. This amount is besides the amount that \\nthe applicant receives for the services provided by them. The only infraction is \\nthat the pure agent is required to incur the expenditure and recover the same later \\nand in this case the payment is made to the Institutions and/or Principal \\nInvestigators only after the same is received from the Sponsor.

The examination of the agreement of Clinical \\nTrial Services since the applicant satisfies all the conditions laid down in the \\nExplanation to Rule 33, the applicant qualifies as a pure agent of the recipient of \\nservice, i.e. the Sponsor.

Inter-State provisions  \\nInter-State provisions are contained under Section 7 of the Integrated Goods \\nand Services Tax Act, 2017 and since none of the specific provisions are \\napplicable, residuary provision contained under Section 7(5) (c) shall be made \\napplicable in the case of intermediary service. \\nThus the provisions of Section 7(5)(c) states that inter-State supply of goods \\nor services or both in the taxable territory shall be treated to be a supply of goods \\nor services or both in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, however, the \\nsame should not be an intra-State supply and should not be covered elsewhere in \\nSection 7 of the Act. \\n5. Intra-State provisions  \\nSection 8 of the Integrated Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 deals with the \\nprovisions of intra-State. Wherein the provisions of Section 8(2) states that the \\nsupply of services where the location of the supplier and the place of supply of \\nservices are in the same State or same Union territory shall be treated as intra-\\nState supply, subject to the provision of Section 12. \\nThe above provisions of inter-state supply and intra-state supply has clearly \\nspecified the position of supply of services where the recipient and the suppliers \\nof services are located in India or in the taxable territory of India and the \\nprovisions of GST law is applicable. \\nIn order to determine the place of supply of services by intermediary in the \\ncase the recipient of service being located outside India, it is required to discuss \\nSection 13 of the IGST Act, 2017. \\nSection 13 of the IGST Act, deals with the place of supply of services where \\nlocation of supplier or location of recipient is outside India.

Provided that where the location of the recipient of services is not \\navailable in the ordinary course of business, the place of supply shall be the \\nlocation of the supplier of services.  \\nThus as per the above cited provisions, the intermediary service is covered in \\nSection 13(8), whereby the place of supply of intermediary services is location of \\nservice provider agent in India and liable to GST. \\n6. Export of Service vis-a-vis intermediary services  \\nSection 2(6) of the IGST Act, 2017 defines “export of services” means the \\nsupply of any service when,— \\n \\n(i) the supplier of service is located in India;  \\n \\n(ii) the recipient of service is located outside India; \\n (iii) the place of supply of service is outside India; \\n (iv) the payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service \\nin convertible foreign exchange; and \\n \\n(v) the supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely \\nestablishments of a distinct person with Explanation 1 of Section 8. \\nIn order to any service to be treated as “export service” must be satisfied the \\nabove cited conditions. In case of intermediary services as per Section 13(8) of \\nthe IGST Act, 2017, the place of supply of the service shall be the location of the \\nsupplier of service is in India.

              " 'Chap. 40 \\nIntermediary Services \\n871 \\n2. Scope of Intermediary services: \\n2.1 ‘Intermediary’ has been defined in the sub-section (13) of section 2 of the \\nIntegrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “IGST” \\nAct) as under–  \\n“Intermediary means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever \\nname called, who arranges or facilitates the supply of goods or services or both, \\nor securities, between two or more persons, but does not include a person who \\nsupplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account.” \\n2.2 The concept of ‘intermediary’ was borrowed in GST from the Service \\nTax Regime. The definition of ‘intermediary’ in the Service Tax law as given in \\nRule 2(f) of Place of Provision of Services Rules, 2012 issued vide notification \\nNo. 28/2012-ST, dated 20-6-2012 was as follows: \\n“intermediary” means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever \\nname called, who arranges or facilitates a provision of a service (hereinafter \\ncalled the ‘main’ service) or a supply of goods, between two or more persons, but \\ndoes not include a person who provides the main service or supplies the goods on \\nhis account;” \\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of “intermediary” under IGST Act as \\nwell as under Service Tax law, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the \\nscope of intermediary services in the GST regime vis-à-vis the Service Tax \\nregime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of intermediary in \\nthe GST Law. \\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services: \\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic \\nprerequisites, which are discussed below: \\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties: By definition, an intermediary is someone \\nwho arranges or facilitates the supplies of goods or services or securities between \\ntwo or more persons. It is thus a natural corollary that the arrangement requires a \\nminimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the supply of goods or \\nservices or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the \\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties can, \\ntherefore, NOT be considered as an intermediary service. An intermediary \\nessentially “arranges or facilitates” another supply (the “main supply”) between \\ntwo or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main supply. \\n3.2 Two distinct supplies: As discussed above, there are two distinct supplies \\nin case of provision of intermediary services;  \\n(1) Main supply, between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods \\nor services or securities;  \\n(2) Ancillary supply, which is the service of facilitating or arranging the main \\nsupply between the two principals. This ancillary supply is supply of \\nintermediary service and is clearly identifiable and distinguished from the main \\nsupply.',\n",
              " '872 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 40 \\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal to principal basis to \\nanother person cannot be considered as supplier of intermediary service.  \\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent, \\nbroker or any other similar person: The definition of “intermediary” itself \\nprovides that intermediary service provider means a broker, an agent or any other \\nperson, by whatever name called….”. This part of the definition is not inclusive \\nbut uses the expression “means” and does not expand the definition by any \\nknown expression of expansion such as “and includes”. The use of the expression \\n“arranges or facilitates” in the definition of “intermediary” suggests a subsidiary \\nrole for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate some other supply, which is \\nthe main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the role of \\nintermediary is only supportive.  \\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or \\nboth or securities on his own account: The definition of intermediary services \\nspecifically mentions that intermediary “does not include a person who supplies \\nsuch goods or services or both or securities on his own account”. Use of word \\n“such” in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the \\nmain supply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more \\npersons, which are arranged or facilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in \\ncases wherein the person supplies the main supply, either fully or partly, on \\nprincipal to principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope of \\n“intermediary”. \\n3.5 Sub-contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An \\nimportant exclusion from intermediary is sub-contracting. The supplier of main \\nservice may decide to outsource the supply of the main service, either fully or \\npartly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub-contractor provides the main \\nsupply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the \\nmain supply between the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore, \\nclearly is not an intermediary. For instance, ‘A’ and ‘B’ have entered into a \\ncontract as per which ‘A’ needs to provide a service of, say, Annual Maintenance \\nof tools and machinery to ‘B’. ‘A’ subcontracts a part or whole of it to ‘C’. \\nAccordingly, ‘C’ provides the service of annual maintenance to ‘A’ as part of \\nsuch sub-contract, by providing annual maintenance of tools and machinery to \\nthe customer of ‘A’, i.e. to ‘B’ on behalf of ‘A’. Though ‘C’ is dealing with the \\ncustomer of ‘A’, but ‘C’ is providing main supply of Annual Maintenance \\nService to ‘A’ on his own account, i.e. on principal to principal basis. In this \\ncase, ‘A’ is providing supply of Annual Maintenance Service to ‘B’, whereas ‘C’ \\nis supplying the same service to ‘A’. Thus, supply of service by ‘C’ in this case \\nwill not be considered as an intermediary.  \\n3.6 The specific provision of place of supply of ‘intermediary services’ under \\nsection 13 of the IGST Act shall be invoked only when either the location of \\nsupplier of intermediary services or location of the recipient of intermediary \\nservices is outside India.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 40 \\nIntermediary Services \\n873 \\n4. Applying the abovementioned guiding principles, the issue of intermediary \\nservices is clarified through the following illustrations: \\nIllustration 1 ‘A’ is a manufacturer and supplier of a machine. ‘C’ helps ‘A’ \\nin selling the machine by identifying client ‘B’ who wants to purchase this \\nmachine and helps in finalizing the contract of supply of machine by ‘A’ to ‘B’. \\n‘C’ charges ‘A’ for his services of locating ‘B’ and helping in finalizing the sale \\nof machine between ‘A’ and ‘B’, for which ‘C’ invoices ‘A’ and is paid by ‘A’ \\nfor the same. While ‘A’ and ‘B’ are involved in the main supply of the \\nmachinery, ‘C’, is facilitating the supply of machine between ‘A’ and ‘B’. In this \\narrangement, ‘C’ is providing the ancillary supply of arranging or facilitating the \\n‘main supply’ of machinery between ‘A’ and ‘B’ and therefore, ‘C’ is an \\nintermediary and is providing intermediary service to ‘A’. \\nIllustration 2 ‘A’ is a software company which develops software for the \\nclients as per their requirement. ‘A’ has a contract with ‘B’ for providing some \\ncustomized software for its business operations. \\n‘A’ outsources the task of design and development of a particular module of \\nthe software to ‘C’, for which “C’ may have to interact with ‘B’, to know their \\nspecific requirements. In this case, ‘C’ is providing main supply of service of \\ndesign and development of software to ‘A’, and thus, ‘C’ is not an intermediary \\nin this case. \\nIllustration 3 An insurance company ‘P’, located outside India, requires to \\nprocess insurance claims of its clients in respect of the insurance service being \\nprovided by ‘P’ to the clients. For processing insurance claims, ‘P’ decides to \\noutsource this work to some other firm. For this purpose, he approaches ‘Q’, \\nlocated in India, for arranging insurance claims processing service from other \\nservice providers in India. ‘Q’ contacts ‘R’, who is in business of providing such \\ninsurance claims processing service, and arranges supply of insurance claims \\nprocessing service by ‘R’ to ‘P’. ‘Q’ charges P a commission or service charge of \\n1% of the contract value of insurance claims processing service provided by ‘R’ \\nto ‘P’. In such a case, main supply of insurance claims processing service is \\nbetween ‘P’ and ‘R’, while ‘Q’ is merely arranging or facilitating the supply of \\nservices between ‘P’ and ‘R’, and not himself providing the main supply of \\nservices. Accordingly, in this case, ‘Q’ acts as an intermediary as per definition \\nof sub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST Act. \\nIllustration 4 ‘A’ is a manufacturer and supplier of computers based in USA \\nand supplies its goods all over the world. As a part of this supply, ‘A’ is also \\nrequired to provide customer care service to its customers to address their queries \\nand complains related to the said supply of computers. ‘A’ decides to outsource \\nthe task of providing customer care services to a BPO firm, ‘B’. ‘B’ provides \\ncustomer care service to ‘A’ by interacting with the customers of ‘A’ and \\naddressing/processing their queries/complains. ’B’ charges ‘A’ for this service. \\n‘B’ is involved in supply of main service ‘customer care service’ to ‘A’, and \\ntherefore, ‘B’ is not an intermediary.',\n",

Meaning of Canteen Service  \\nCanteen means the common place for refreshment or eating place for the \\nindustrial worker, which is generally situated in the premises of an industrial unit. \\nCanteen Service is one of the welfare activities of any Industrial organisation \\nregistered under Factories Act, 1948. The Factories Act, 1948, indicates that a \\nfactory having more than 250 workers, shall provide and maintain a canteen for \\ngiving subsidized food to the workers and employees. Section 46 of the Factories \\nAct, 1948, deals with the provision of canteen facility in factories. The \\norganization can also deploy canteen contractors for providing subsidized foods. \\n2. Taxability of canteen services in the GST regime  \\nCanteen service implies supply of subsidized or concessional foods and \\nbeverages to the employees or staffs as part of welfare activities of any industrial \\nunit. \\nSince “Supply” is the taxable event under GST. The nature of supply, time of \\nsupply and place of supply of goods and services determines the tax liability \\nunder GST. \\nThe moot question is arises.

Meaning of Intellectual Property Right  \\nIntellectual Property Right (IPR) is not a new concept in the modern world. \\nIntellectual Property Rights are set of rights associated with creations of the \\nhuman mind that spontaneously emerges from application of intellect, which may \\nbe in the form of an invention, design, trademark, formula, product process, \\ntechnology, book, goodwill etc. So an output of the human mind may contribute \\nto creation of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property has been \\nrecognized as a very important asset for any business in the present scenario of \\nworld economy. Intellectual property rights are protected by statutory laws. \\n2. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights  \\nIn India Government has made legislation for the protection of Intellectual \\nProperty Rights namely, Patents Act, Copyright Act. Trademarks Act and \\nDesigns Act. With regard to protection of Intellectual property rights in other \\ncountries, they follow the international legal instruments. The establishment of \\nthe World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is an important milestone \\nin the history of human-kind that recognizes the legitimate rights of the creator of \\nthe work and protects him against unfair competition. \\n3. Taxable event under GST \\n“Supply” is the taxable event under GST, in place of “taxable goods “and \\n“taxable services” as was prevailed in the earlier tax laws for the purpose of levy \\nof tax. Section 2(108) of the CGST Act, defines “Taxable supply” means a \\nsupply of goods or services or both which is leviable to tax under GST. Thus, \\nGST is levied upon the “supplies of goods and services”. Section 9(1) of the',\n",
              " 'Chap. 44 \\nIntellectual Property Right (IPR) under GST \\n893 \\n \\nCGST Act, states that tax shall be levied on the transaction value of a supply of \\ngoods or services or both. \\n4. Definition of “Goods” \\nSection 2(52) of the CGST Act, “goods” means every kind of movable \\nproperty other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing \\ncrops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to \\nbe severed before supply or under a contract of supply; \\n5. Definition of “Services”  \\nSection 2(102) of the CGST Act, “services” means anything other than \\ngoods, money and securities but includes activities relating to the use of money \\nor its conversion by cash or by any other mode, from one form, currency or \\ndenomination, to another form, currency or denomination for which a separate \\nconsideration is charged; \\n6. Intellectual Property Rights under GST  \\nEven though, Intellectual Property Rights has not been defined under CGST \\nAct; by plain reading of the definition of “goods” it is clear that Intellectual \\nProperty Rights qualifies as goods. Further, section 5(c) of schedule II of the \\nCGST Act, specified that “temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment \\nof any intellectual property right to be considered as supply of services. \\nAccordingly, the Central Government, on the recommendations of the GST \\nCouncil, have notified the taxable rates of “Intellectual property rights “both \\nunder classification of goods as well as classification of services. \\n7.

The contract for supply therefore assumes \\nsignificant in this test to decide whether or not there has been ‘temporary transfer \\nor permitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right.  \\nThus temporary/permanent transfer a particular intellectual property right \\nwould be considered as supply of service and 12% tax would be levied on the \\ntransaction value provided such IPR is not in respect of software. The \\nsale/licensing of intellectual property right pertaining to software would be \\ncharged 18% tax. \\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Constitutional amendment Act, 2016 did \\nnot amend Article 366(29A)(d) which specifies that the transfer of the right to \\nuse any goods is to be deemed as a sale of those goods. Further, once IPR is \\ntreated as goods, a permanent transfer of such IPR would amount to a sale of \\ngoods; will be the same as to a supply of goods. However, the Central \\nGovernment while notifying the tax rate of services has classified the transfer of \\nthe right to use any goods to be treated as service.  \\n8. Classification & rate of goods of IPR \\nWhile taxable rates of goods were notified vide Notification No. 1/2017-C.T. \\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017, unfortunately this notification did not contains any \\nspecific entry or rates for taxing Intellectual Property Rights as goods. \\nSubsequently, as per the recommendations made by the GST Council meeting \\nheld on 10th November, 2017, rates of Intellectual property rights has been \\ninserted at Sl.

There is need of proper classification of \\nIPR/tax rates of CGST, SGST & IGST for goods. It is pertinent to mention that \\nthere is no rate of tax on IPR as goods during the period 1st July’2017 to 13th \\nNovember’2017. The Central Government as well as GST Council even though \\nhas notified tax rate of IPR as goods by inserting necessary entry in CGST rate \\nand IGST rate but both the Notifications have been declared as prospective. \\nSince the imposition of rate is not retrospective to cover the tax rate period from \\n1st July’2017 to 13th November’2017, demands raised on permanent transfer of \\nIPR will create litigations in the coming days. \\nThus, It is observed that, under GST is the dual Classification of rate of tax \\non IPR needs to be reviewed by the GST Council and necessary clarification may \\nbe issued for smooth tax collection and reduction of probable litigation on \\naccount of interpretation of taxability on IPR in the coming days. \\n10. FAQ for GST on IT/ITES \\nQuestion 1: Whether software is regarded as goods or services in GST? \\nAnswer: In terms of Schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017, development, \\ndesign, programming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement, \\nimplementation of information technology software and temporary transfer or \\npermitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right are treated as \\nservices. \\nBut, if a pre-developed or pre-designed software is supplied in any medium/ \\nstorage (commonly bought off-the-shelf) or made available through the use of \\nencryption keys, the same is treated as a supply of goods classifiable under \\nheading 8523. \\nQuestion 2: What are the implications of recognising the development, design, \\nprogramming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement, and \\nimplementation of information technology software as a service? \\nAnswer: The primary implication is that the place of supply rules applicable \\nto services would apply in determining taxability of the supply of software \\nservices. The same would be applicable in situations of supply of services \\ninvolving a temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any \\nintellectual property right. The other implication is that the supplier of software \\nservices would not be eligible for the composition scheme. \\nQuestion 3: ‘A’ is a dealer in Computers and Computer parts having turnover \\nof Rs. 8 lakh in a year; does ‘A’ have to register under GST? \\nAnswer: Every supplier located in a State or Union territory, whose  \\n“aggregate turnover” in a financial year exceeds twenty lakh rupees, is liable to \\nbe registered under GST. This limit of turnover for a special category State is ten',\n",
              " 'Chap. 44 \\nIntellectual Property Right (IPR) under GST \\n897 \\n \\nlakh rupees. ‘A’, whose aggregate turnover is only Rs. 8 lakh in a year, is \\ntherefore not liable to registration. \\nQuestion 4: The registered person ‘B’ receives small portions of software code  \\nfrom individuals which he then integrates and supply as a package to clients. \\nThese individuals are having small turnover of Rs. 5 to 10 lakh, and therefore \\nare not registered in GST. Whether there is any liability on ‘B’ in respect of \\nservices provided by such individuals? \\nAnswer: If the supplies are made by unregistered suppliers, GST is liable to \\nbe paid by the recipient, who is a registered person, under section 9(4) of the \\nCGST Act, 2017. Therefore, in this case ‘B’ is liable to pay GST on services \\nprovided by these individuals. ‘B’ can claim credit of this tax paid by him on \\nreverse charge. \\nQuestion 5: What is the rate of tax on IT services? \\nAnswer: The rate of GST on IT services is 18%. \\nQuestion 6: Whether exports of software services attract GST? \\nAnswer: Exports and supplies to SEZ units and SEZ developers are zero-\\nrated in GST. Zero-rating effectively means that no tax is payable on exports but \\nthe exporter/supplier is entitled to the input tax credit on inputs/input services \\nused in relation to exports. The exporters have two options for zero rating, which \\nare as follows: \\n(1) To pay integrated tax on supplies meant to be exported and get refund of \\ntax so paid after the supply is exported. \\n(2) To make export supplies under a bond or letter of undertaking and claim \\nrefund of taxes suffered on inputs and input services in relation to such \\nexports. \\nQuestion 7: How do I determine whether IT services provided by me constitute \\nexport of service? \\nAnswer: The supply of any service is considered an export of service, where \\nthe following conditions are met: \\n(1) the supplier of service is located in India; \\n(2) the recipient of service is located outside India; \\n(3) the place of supply of service is outside India; \\n(4) the payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service \\nin convertible foreign exchange; and \\n(5) the supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely \\nestablishments of a distinct person in accordance with explanation 1 of \\nsection 8 of the IGST Act, 2017. \\nQuestion 8: How do I determine the place of supply of IT/ITES services? \\nAnswer: Place of supply of IT/ITES services is the location of the recipient  \\nin terms of section 12 and 13 of the IGST Act, 2017. However, if the recipient is',\n",
              " '898 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 44 \\n \\nnot registered and his address is not available on the records of the supplier, the \\nplace of supply would be the location of the supplier. \\nQuestion 9: How to determine the location of the recipient? \\nAnswer: Location of the recipient of service is defined in section 2(14) of  \\nthe IGST Act. A recipient of services is treated as located outside India if his \\nplace of business where he receives services is outside India or, if he does not \\nhave a place of business, his usual place of residence is outside India. \\nQuestion 10: Would I be liable to pay GST on reverse charge even if the \\nforeign supplier of software from whom I buy for use in my firm registered \\nunder GST was to accept the payment in Indian Rupees? \\nAnswer: Yes, you would be liable to pay GST. A supply is treated as an \\nimport of service if the following conditions are satisfied: \\n(1) the supplier of service is located outside India; \\n(2) the recipient of service is located in India; and \\n(3) the place of supply of service is in India. \\nThe place of such supply would be taken to be the location where the firm is \\nregistered (in GST) and the supplies would attract integrated tax (IGST). The \\nfactum of which currency was used to pay the consideration is immaterial. \\nQuestion 11: I am an Indian Company who makes software and sells it outside \\nthe country. I have hired a firm (not a related party) ‘C’ located abroad to \\nfacilitate the supply of software in Europe and the USA; would I be liable to \\npay GST on the payments that I make to this entity abroad? \\nAnswer: No. In this case, ‘C’ is covered by the definition of ‘intermediary’ \\n[section 2(13) of the IGST Act, 2017]. The place of supply of such intermediary \\nservice is location of the supplier in terms of section 13(8) of the IGST Act, \\n2017. As ‘C’ is located outside India, GST is not payable in this case. \\nQuestion 12: What factors determine the location of ‘C’ (in question 11) as \\nbeing outside India? \\nAnswer: In terms of section 2(15) of the IGST Act, 2017, the location of a \\nservice provider is to be determined by applying the following steps sequentially: \\n(1) where a supply is made from a place of business for which the \\nregistration has been obtained, the location of such place of business; \\n(2) where a supply is made from a place other than the place of business for \\nwhich registration has been obtained (a fixed establishment elsewhere), \\nthe location of such fixed establishment; \\n(3) where a supply is made from more than one establishment, whether the \\nplace of business or fixed establishment, the location of the \\nestablishment most directly concerned with the provision of the supply; \\nand \\n(4) in absence of such places, the location of the usual place of residence of \\nthe supplier.',\n",

For agency services, I bill the principal in convertible \\nforeign exchange. Whether GST liability arises in this case? \\nAnswer: You are an intermediary and the place of supply of the service \\nprovided by you to the principal is in India irrespective of the mode of payment. \\nHence, GST is payable on the services provided by you as an intermediary to the \\nprincipal. \\nQuestion 14: I have more than one SEZ unit in different States; do I need to \\ntake separate registrations? Also, I have two SEZ units in one State. Can I take \\na single registration? \\nAnswer: (1) Yes. Under GST, every entity shall take GST registration in \\neach State from which it makes taxable supplies. However, a single registration \\ncan be taken for all your SEZ units within a State, whether located in one SEZ or \\nmore than one SEZ. \\n(2) A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as outside \\nthe SEZ in a State shall make a separate application for registration for SEZ \\nunit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the \\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017). \\nQuestion 15: I have a unit in the DTA and another in the SEZ; can I take a \\ncommon registration? \\nAnswer: No. A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as \\noutside the SEZ in a State, shall make a separate application for registration for \\nSEZ unit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the \\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017). \\nQuestion 16: If I supply a laptop bag along with the laptop to my customer, \\nwhat would be the rate of tax leviable? \\nAnswer: If the laptop bag is supplied along with the laptop in the ordinary \\ncourse of business, the principal supply is that of the laptop and the bag is an \\nancillary. Therefore, it is a composite supply and the rate of tax would that as \\napplicable to the laptop. \\nQuestion 17: I am obtaining online database access services from a company \\nabroad over the net, would I have to pay tax on reverse charge? \\nAnswer: The recipient, if registered, has to pay the applicable IGST on \\nreverse charge basis.

The agreement is renewable and/or could be \\namended from time to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of \\nsupply involved when software is delivered to its customer, the terms and \\nconditions of EULA are material. \\nThe contract for supply therefore assumes significance in this test to decide \\nwhether or not there has been ‘temporary transfer or permitting the use or \\nenjoyment of any intellectual property right’. \\nQuestion 19: What special provisions are attracted in GST with regard to \\nassociated enterprises? \\nAnswer: An enterprise which participates, either directly or indirectly, \\nthrough one or more intermediaries, in the management, or control or capital of \\nthe other enterprise is an associated enterprise. In the context of GST, associated \\nenterprise is particularly relevant in the case of supply of services, where the \\nsupplier is located outside India. In such cases, the time of supply will be the \\nearlier of date of entry in the books of account of the recipient of supply or the \\ndate of payment - thus, within ‘associated enterprises’, the levy under GST is \\nattracted once such book entries are made even if no actual payment takes place \\nor no invoice is issued. \\nQuestion 20: What would be the tax liability on replacement of parts (no \\nconsideration is charged from a customer) under a warranty and whether the \\nsupplier is required to reverse the input tax credit? \\nAnswer: As parts are provided to the customer without a consideration under \\nwarranty, no GST is chargeable on such replacement. The value of supply made \\nearlier includes the charges to be incurred during the warranty period. Therefore, \\nthe supplier who has undertaken the warranty replacement is not required to \\nreverse the input tax credit on the parts/components replaced. \\nQuestion 21: An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has an obligation \\nto provide repair services to their customers in the warranty period. This \\nactivity is outsourced by OEM to ‘D’, who bills the OEM for the services he \\nprovides to the customer. What is the tax liability of ‘D’? \\nAnswer: ‘D’ is providing service to the OEM. GST is payable on the value \\nof any supplies made by ‘D’ to OEM i.e. in respect of bills raised by ‘D’ on the \\nOEM.',\n",

GST shall be chargeable \\non the repair amount, including the cost of parts, charged by the repairing centre. \\nQuestion 23: What is the tax liability in a scenario where supplies are made \\nfrom multiple locations (in different States) of the supplier to the recipient \\nunder a single contract? \\nAnswer: Delivering services from various locations and integrated pricing \\nfor the contract as a whole is the norm in IT/ITES industry. Normally the \\ncontract or agreement with the recipient is entered into by one of the branches \\n(let us say “Main Branch”). Therefore, in such cases of service delivery from \\nmultiple locations of the supplier to the recipient, the supply could be visualized \\nas consisting of two distinct supplies. First supply - the different branches of the \\nsupplier located across different States are making the supply to the main branch \\nwhich entered into a contact or an agreement with the recipient for the supply of \\nsuch service. Second supply - main branch is making a supply to the customer. \\nGST is to be levied accordingly.

Meaning of Actionable Claim  \\nThe concept of “actionable claim” owes its roots from erstwhile Service Tax \\nlaw, CST, VAT law of the most of the States and Transfer of property Act, 1882. \\nGST law makers while explaining the meaning of “goods “under Section 2(52) of \\nthe Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 defines “goods” means every kind \\nof movable property other than money and securities but includes actionable \\nclaim, growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land \\nwhich are agreed to be served before supply or under a contract of supply”. With \\nthe legacy of the past, GST law makers have rightly incorporated the concept of \\nactionable claim as goods under GST.  \\n2. Scope of Actionable Claims under GST  \\nGST law makers have incorporated “actionable claims” under scope of \\nsupply in order to levy and collect GST. The expression supply includes \\nActionable Claims other than lottery; batting and gambling Section 7(2)(a) read \\nwith Sl.No. 6 of Schedule III to the CGST Act, 2017 wherein it has been \\nspecified that actionable claims other than lottery, betting and gambling shall be \\nneither a supply of goods nor a supply of services. By this specific provision only \\nactionable claims of lottery, betting and gambling are subjected to GST.  \\nIt is pertinent to mention that the definition of Service Tax law as excluded \\n“actionable claims” and lottery, betting and gambling were included in the \\nnegative list of Service Tax. However, under Service tax for the expression \\n“transaction in money or actionable claim” shall not include any activity carried \\nout, for a consideration, in relation to, or for facilitation of, including the activity \\ncarried out by a lottery distributor or selling agent on behalf of the State \\nGovernment, in relation to promotion, marketing, organizing, selling of lottery or \\nfacilitating in organizing lottery of any kind, in any other manner, in accordance \\nwith the provisions of the lotteries (Regulation) Act,1998.

Meaning of betting and gambling  \\n“In India the State Legislature has been entrusted with the power to frame \\nstate specific laws on “betting and gambling” as provided under Seventh \\nSchedule, list II, Entry No. 34 of the Constitution. Every state has their own \\nlegislation to regulate gaming/gambling activities within its territory.  \\nBetting and gambling has not been defined under GST but it was defined \\nunder Section 65B(15) of the Finance Act, 1994, Betting or gambling means \\nputting on stake something of value, particularly money, with consciousness of \\nrisk and hope of gain on the outcome of a game or a contest, whose result may be \\ndetermined by chance or accident, or on the likelihood of anything occurring or \\nnot occurring”. \\n5. Taxability of Actionable Claims under GST  \\nActionable claims, other than lottery, betting and gambling shall be treated \\nneither as a supply of goods nor a supply of services, auxiliary services for all \\nactionable claims are independent service liable for GST. Supply of lottery has \\nbeen treated as supply of goods under the GST law. Accordingly, rate for supply \\nof lottery has been notified under relevant GST rate notifications. Lottery \\nservices have been allotted Service Code (Tariff) as 999694.  \\nEntry 62 in the State List in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has \\nbeen substituted.

As is evident from the \\nnotification, “entry to casinos” and “gambling” are two different services, and \\nGST is leviable at 28% on both these services (14% CGST and 14% SGST) on \\nthe value determined as per Section 15 of the CGST Act. Thus, GST@28% \\nwould apply on entry to casinos as well as on betting/gambling services being \\nprovided by casinos on the transaction value of betting, i.e. the total bet value, in \\naddition to GST levy on any other services being provided by the casinos (such \\nas services by way of supply of food/drinks etc. at the casinos).

If entire value is `100/-, GST leviable will be ` 28/-. \\nThe GST law makers have incorporated the clear position under GST and \\nhave been included “actionable claims” in the definition of “goods” But while \\ncharging GST have included the services of admission into casino under Heading \\nNo. 9996 vide Notification No. 11/2017-CT (Rate) dated 28th June, 2017 and the \\nvalue of services relating to casinos and gambling has been clarified vide \\nCircular No. 27/01/2018-GST, dated 4th January, 2018.

The said expression has following three limbs: \\n \\n(a) Agreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act.—Example of activities \\nthat would be covered by this part of the expression would include non-\\ncompete agreements, where one party agrees not to compete with the \\nother party in a product, service or geographical area against a \\nconsideration paid by the other party. Another example of such activities \\nwould be a builder refraining from constructing more than a certain \\nnumber of floors, even though permitted to do so by the municipal \\nauthorities, against a compensation paid by the neighbouring housing \\nproject, which wants to protect its sunlight, or an industrial unit \\nrefraining from manufacturing activity during certain hours against an \\nagreed compensation paid by a neighbouring school, which wants to \\navoid noise during those hours. \\n \\n(b) Agreeing to the obligation to tolerate an act or a situation.—This would \\ninclude activities such a shopkeeper allowing a hawker to operate from \\nthe common pavement in front of his shop against a monthly payment by \\nthe hawker, or an RWA tolerating the use of loud speakers for early \\nmorning prayers by a school located in the colony subject to the school \\npaying an agreed sum to the RWA as compensation \\n \\n(c) Agreeing to the obligation to tolerate an act or a situation.—This would \\ninclude activities such a shopkeeper allowing a hawker to operate from \\nthe common pavement in front of his shop against a monthly payment by \\nthe hawker, or an RWA tolerating the use of loud speakers for early \\nmorning prayers by a school located in the colony subject to the school \\npaying an agreed sum to the RWA as compensation. \\n3. The description “agreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act or to \\ntolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act” was intended to cover services such \\nas described above. However, over the years doubts have persisted regarding \\nvarious transactions being classified under the said description.',\n",

In Service Tax law, ‘Service’ was defined as any activity carried out by a \\nperson for another for consideration. As discussed in service tax education guide, \\nthe concept ‘activity for a consideration’ involves an element of contractual \\nrelationship wherein the person doing an activity does so at the desire of the \\nperson for whom the activity is done in exchange for a consideration. An activity \\ndone without such a relationship i.e., without the express or implied contractual \\nreciprocity of a consideration would not be an ‘activity for consideration’. The \\nelement of contractual relationship, where one supplies goods or services at the \\ndesire or another, is an essential element of supply. \\n5. The description of the declared service in question, namely, agreeing to the \\nobligation to refrain from an act or to tolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act \\nin para 5(e) of Schedule II of CGST Act is strikingly similar to the definition of \\ncontract in the Contract Act, 1872. The Contract Act defines ‘Contract’ as a set \\nof promises, forming consideration for each other. ‘Promise’ has been defined as \\nwillingness of the ‘promisor’ to do or to abstain from doing anything. \\n‘Consideration’ has been defined in the Contract Act as what the ‘promisee’ does \\nor abstains from doing for the promises made to him. \\n6. This goes to show that the service of agreeing to the obligation to refrain \\nfrom an act or to tolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act is nothing but a \\ncontractual agreement. A contract to do something or to abstain from doing \\nsomething cannot be said to have taken place unless there are two parties, one of \\nwhich expressly or impliedly agrees to do or abstain from doing something and',\n",
              " '910 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 46 \\nthe other agrees to pay consideration to the first party for doing or abstaining \\nfrom such an act. There must be a necessary and sufficient nexus between the \\nsupply (i.e. agreement to do or to abstain from doing something) and the \\nconsideration. \\n6.1 A perusal of the entry at serial 5(e) of Schedule II would reveal that it \\ncomprises the aforementioned three different sets of activities viz. (a) the \\nobligation to refrain from an act, (b) obligation to tolerate an act or a situation \\nand (c) obligation to do an act. All the three activities must be under an \\n“agreement” or a “contract” (whether express or implied) to fall within the ambit \\nof the said entry. In other words, one of the parties to such agreement/contract \\n(the first party) must be under a contractual obligation to either (a) refrain from \\nan act, or (b) to tolerate an act or a situation or (c) to do an act. Further some \\n“consideration” must flow in return from the other party to this contract/ \\nagreement (the second party) to the first party for such (a) refraining or  \\n(b) tolerating or (c) doing. Such contractual arrangement must be an independent \\narrangement in its own right. Such arrangement or agreement can take the form \\nof an independent stand-alone contract or may form part of another contract. \\nThus, a person (the first person) can be said to be making a supply by way of \\nrefraining from doing something or tolerating some act or situation to another \\nperson (the second person) if the first person was under an obligation to do so \\nand then performed accordingly. \\n5.1 Agreement to do or refrain from an act should not be presumed to exist \\n7. There has to be an express or implied agreement; oral or written, to do or \\nabstain from doing something against payment of consideration for doing or \\nabstaining from such act, for a taxable supply to exist. An agreement to do an act \\nor abstain from doing an act or to tolerate an act or a situation cannot be \\nimagined or presumed to exist just because there is a flow of money from one \\nparty to another. Unless there is an express or implied promise by the recipient of \\nmoney to agree to do or abstain from doing something in return for the money \\npaid to him, it cannot be assumed that such payment was for doing an act or for \\nrefraining from an act or for tolerating an act or situation. Payments such as \\nliquidated damages for breach of contract, penalties under the mining act for \\nexcess stock found with the mining company, forfeiture of salary or payment of \\namount as per the employment bond for leaving the employment before the \\nminimum agreed period, penalty for cheque dishonour etc. are not a \\nconsideration for tolerating an act or situation. They are rather amounts recovered \\nfor not tolerating an act or situation and to deter such acts; such amounts are for \\npreventing breach of contract or non-performance and are thus mere ‘events’ in a \\ncontract. Further, such amounts do not constitute payment (or consideration) for \\ntolerating an act, because there cannot be any contract: (a) for breach thereof, or \\n(b) for holding more stock than permitted under the mining contract, or (c) for \\nleaving the employment before the agreed minimum period or (d) for doing \\nsomething leading to the dishonour of a cheque. As has already been stated, \\nunless payment has been made for an independent activity of tolerating an act',\n",
              " 'Chap. 46 \\nLiquidated Damages under GST \\n911 \\nunder an independent arrangement entered into for such activity of tolerating an \\nact, such payments will not constitute ‘consideration’ and hence such activities \\nwill not constitute “supply” within the meaning of the Act. Taxability of these \\ntransactions is discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs. \\n5.2 Liquidated Damages \\n7.1 Breach or non-performance of contract by one party results in loss and \\ndamages to the other party. Therefore, the law provides in Section 73 of the \\nContract Act, 1972 that when a contract has been broken, the party which suffers \\nby such breach is entitled to receive from the other party compensation for any \\nloss or damage caused to him by such breach. The compensation is not by way of \\nconsideration for any other independent activity; it is just an event in the course \\nof performance of that contract. \\n7.1.1.1 It is common for the parties entering into a contract, to specify in the \\ncontract itself, the compensation that would be payable in the event of the breach \\nof the contract. Such compensation specified in a written contract for breach of \\nnon-performance of the contract or parties of the contract is referred to as \\nliquidated damages. Black’s Law Dictionary defines ‘Liquidated Damages’ as \\ncash compensation agreed to by a signed, written contract for breach of contract, \\npayable to the aggrieved party. \\n7.1.2 Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1972 provides that when a contract is \\nbroken, if a sum has been named or a penalty stipulated in the contract as the \\namount or penalty to be paid in case of breach, the aggrieved party shall be \\nentitled to receive reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named \\nor the penalty so stipulated.  \\n7.1.3 It is argued that performance is the essence of a contract. Liquidated \\ndamages cannot be said to be a consideration received for tolerating the breach or \\nnon-performance of contract. They are rather payments for not tolerating the \\nbreach of contract. Payment of liquidated damages is stipulated in a contract to \\nensure performance and to deter non-performance, unsatisfactory performance or \\ndelayed performance. Liquidated damages are a measure of loss and damage that \\nthe parties agree would arise due to breach of contract. They do not act as a \\nremedy for the breach of contract. They do not restitute the aggrieved person. It \\nis further argued that a contract is entered into for execution and not for its \\nbreach. The liquidated damages or penalty are not the desired outcome of the \\ncontract. By accepting the liquidated damages, the party aggrieved by breach of \\ncontract cannot be said to have permitted or tolerated the deviation or non-\\nfulfilment of the promise by the other party. \\n7.1.4 In this background a reasonable view that can be taken with regard to \\ntaxability of liquidated damages is that where the amount paid as ‘liquidated \\ndamages’ is an amount paid only to compensate for injury, loss or damage \\nsuffered by the aggrieved party due to breach of the contract and there is no \\nagreement, express or implied, by the aggrieved party receiving the liquidated \\ndamages, to refrain from or tolerate an act or to do anything for the party paying \\nthe liquidated damages, in such cases liquidated damages are mere a flow of',\n",

Such payments do not constitute \\nconsideration for a supply and are not taxable. \\n7.1.5 Examples of such cases are damages resulting from damage to \\nproperty, negligence, piracy, unauthorized use of trade name, copyright, etc. \\nOther examples that may be covered here are the penalty stipulated in a contract \\nfor delayed construction of houses. It is a penalty paid by the builder to the \\nbuyers to compensate them for the loss that they suffer due to such delayed \\nconstruction and not for getting anything in return from the buyers. Similarly, \\nforfeiture of earnest money by a seller in case of breach of ‘an agreement to sell’ \\nan immovable property by the buyer or by Government or local authority in the \\nevent of a successful bidder failing to act after winning the bid, for allotment of \\nnatural resources, is a mere flow of money, as the buyer or the successful bidder \\ndoes not get anything in return for such forfeiture of earnest money. Forfeiture of \\nEarnest money is stipulated in such cases not as a consideration for tolerating the \\nbreach of contract but as a compensation for the losses suffered and as a penalty \\nfor discouraging the non-serious buyers or bidders. Such payments being merely \\nflow of money are not a consideration for any supply and are not taxable. The \\nkey in such cases is to consider whether the impugned payments constitute \\nconsideration for another independent contract envisaging tolerating an act or \\nsituation or refraining from doing any act or situation or simply doing an act. If \\nthe answer is yes, then it constitutes a ‘supply’ within the meaning of the Act, \\notherwise it is not a “supply”. \\n7.1.6 If a payment constitutes a consideration for a supply, then it is taxable \\nirrespective of by what name it is called; it must be remembered that a \\n“consideration” cannot be considered de hors an agreement/contract between two \\npersons wherein one person does something for another and that other pays the \\nfirst in return. If the payment is merely an event in the course of the performance \\nof the agreement and it does not represent the ‘object’, as such, of the contract \\nthen it cannot be considered ‘consideration’. For example, a contract may \\nprovide that payment by the recipient of goods or services shall be made before a \\ncertain date and failure to make payment by the due date shall attract late fee or \\npenalty. A contract for transport of passengers may stipulate that the ticket \\namount shall be partly or wholly forfeited if the passenger does not show up. A \\ncontract for package tour may stipulate forfeiture of security deposit in the event \\nof cancellation of tour by the customer. Similarly, a contract for lease of movable \\nor immovable property may stipulate that the lessee shall not terminate the lease \\nbefore a certain period and if he does so he will have to pay certain amount as \\nearly termination fee or penalty. Some banks similarly charge pre-payment \\npenalty if the borrower wishes to repay the loan before the maturity of the loan \\nperiod. Such amounts paid for acceptance of late payment, early termination of \\nlease or for pre-payment of loan or the amounts forfeited on cancellation of \\nservice by the customer as contemplated by the contract as part of commercial \\nterms agreed to by the parties, constitute consideration for the supply of a \\nfacility, namely, of acceptance of late payment, early termination of a lease',\n",

Therefore, such payments, even though \\nthey may be referred to as fine or penalty, are actually payments that amount to \\nconsideration for supply, and are subject to GST, in cases where such supply is \\ntaxable. Since these supplies are ancillary to the principal supply for which the \\ncontract is signed, they shall be eligible to be assessed as the principal supply, as \\ndiscussed in detail in the later paragraphs. Naturally, such payments will not be \\ntaxable if the principal supply is exempt.  \\n5.3 Compensation for cancellation of coal blocks \\n7.2 In the year 2014, coal block/mine allocations were cancelled by the \\nHon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 24.09.2014. Subsequently, Coal Mines \\n(Special Provisions) Act, 2015 was enacted to provide for allocation of coal \\nmines and vesting of rights, title and interest in and over the land and mines \\ninfrastructure together with mining leases to successful bidders and allottees. In \\naccordance with section 16 of the said Act, prior (old) allottee of mines were \\ngiven compensation in the year 2016 towards the transfer of their rights/titles in \\nthe land, mine infrastructure, geological reports, consents, approvals etc. to the \\nnew entity (successful bidder) as per the directions of Hon’ble Supreme Court. \\n7.2.1 There was no agreement between the prior allottees of coal blocks and \\nthe Government that the previous allottees shall agree to or tolerate cancellation \\nof the coal blocks allocated to them if the Government pays compensation to \\nthem. No such promise or offer was made by the prior allottees to the \\nGovernment. The allottees had no option but to accept the cancellation. The \\ncompensation was given to them for such cancellation, not under a contract \\nbetween the allottees and the Government, but under the provisions of the statute \\nand in pursuance of the Supreme Court Order. Therefore, it would be incorrect to \\nsay that the prior allottees of the coal blocks supplied a service to the \\nGovernment by way of agreeing to tolerate the cancellation of the allocations \\nmade to them by the Government or that the compensation paid by the \\nGovernment for such cancellation in pursuance to the order of the Supreme Court \\nwas a consideration for such service. Therefore, the compensation paid for \\ncancellation of coal blocks pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court in the \\nabove case was not taxable. \\n5.4 Cheque dishonour fine/penalty \\n7.3 No supplier wants a cheque given to him to be dis honoured. It entails \\nextra administrative cost to him and disruption of his routine activities and cash \\nflow. The promise made by any supplier of goods or services is to make supply \\nagainst payment within an agreed time (including the agreed permissible time \\nwith late payment) through a valid instrument. There is never an implied or \\nexpress offer or willingness on part of the supplier that he would tolerate deposit \\nof an invalid, fake or unworthy instrument of payment against consideration in \\nthe form of cheque dishonour fine or penalty. The fine or penalty that the \\nsupplier or a banker imposes, for dishonour of a cheque, is a penalty imposed not \\nfor tolerating the act or situation but a fine, or penalty imposed for not tolerating,',\n",
              " '914 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 46 \\npenalizing and thereby deterring and discouraging such an act or situation. \\nTherefore, cheque dishonour fine or penalty is not a consideration for any service \\nand not taxable. \\n5.5 Penalty imposed for violation of laws \\n7.4 Penalty imposed for violation of laws such as traffic violations, or for \\nviolation of pollution norms or other laws are also not consideration for any \\nsupply received and are not taxable, which are also not taxable. Same is the case \\nwith fines, penalties imposed by the mining Department of a Central or State \\nGovernment or a local authority on discovering mining of excess mineral beyond \\nthe permissible limit or of mining activities in violation of the mining permit. \\nSuch penalties imposed for violation of laws cannot be regarded as consideration \\ncharged by Government or a Local Authority for tolerating violation of laws. \\nLaws are not framed for tolerating their violation. They stipulate penalty not for \\ntolerating violation but for not tolerating, penalizing and deterring such \\nviolations. There is no agreement between the Government and the violator \\nspecifying that violation would be allowed or permitted against payment of fine \\nor penalty. There cannot be such an agreement as violation of law is never a \\nlawful object or consideration. The service tax education guide issued in 2012 on \\nadvent of negative list regime of services explained that fines and penalties paid \\nfor violation of provisions of law are not considerations as no service is received \\nin lieu of payment of such fines and penalties. \\n7.4.1 It was also clarified vide Circular No. 192/02/2016-Service Tax, dated \\n13.04.2016 that fines and penalty chargeable by Government or a local authority \\nimposed for violation of a statute, bye-laws, rules or regulations are not leviable \\nto Service Tax. The same holds true for GST also \\n5.6 Forfeiture of salary or payment of bond amount in the event of the \\nemployee leaving the employment before the minimum agreed period \\n7.5 An employer carries out an elaborate selection process and incurs \\nexpenditure in recruiting an employee, invests in his training and makes him a \\npart of the organization, privy to its processes and business secrets in the \\nexpectation that the recruited employee would work for the organization for a \\ncertain minimum period. Premature leaving of the employment results in \\ndisruption of work and an undesirable situation. The provisions for forfeiture of \\nsalary or recovery of bond amount in the event of the employee leaving the \\nemployment before the minimum agreed period are incorporated in the \\nemployment contract to discourage non-serious candidates from taking up \\nemployment. The said amounts are recovered by the employer not as a \\nconsideration for tolerating the act of such premature quitting of employment but \\nas penalties for dissuading the non-serious employees from taking up \\nemployment and to discourage and deter such a situation. Further, the employee \\ndoes not get anything in return from the employer against payment of such \\namounts. Therefore, such amounts recovered by the employer are not taxable as \\nconsideration for the service of agreeing to tolerate an act or a situation.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 46 \\nLiquidated Damages under GST \\n915 \\n5.7 Compensation for not collecting toll charges \\n8. In the wake of demonetization, NHAI directed the concessionaires (toll \\noperators) to allow free access of toll roads to the users from 8.11.2016 to \\n1.12.2016 for which the loss of toll charge was paid as compensation by NHAI as \\nper the instructions of Ministry of Road Transportation and Highways. The toll \\nreimbursements were calculated based on the average monthly collection of toll. \\nA question arose whether the compensation paid to the concessionaire by project \\nauthorities (NHAI) in lieu of suspension of toll collection during the \\ndemonetization period (from 8.11.2016 to 1.12.2016) was taxable as a service by \\nway of agreeing to refrain from collection of toll from users. \\n8.1 It has been clarified vide Circular No. 212/2/2019-ST, dated 21.05.2019 \\nthat the service that is provided by toll operators is that of access to a road or \\nbridge, toll charges being merely a consideration for that service. During the \\nperiod from 8.11.2016 to 1.12.2016, the service of access to a road or bridge \\ncontinued to be provided without collection of toll from users. Consideration \\ncame from the project authority. The fact that for this period, for the same \\nservice, consideration came from a person other than the actual user of service \\ndoes not mean that the service has changed. \\n5.8 Late payment surcharge or fee \\n9. The facility of accepting late payments with interest or late payment fee, \\nfine or penalty is a facility granted by supplier naturally bundled with the main \\nsupply. It is not uncommon or unnatural for customers to sometimes miss the last \\ndate of payment of electricity, water, telecommunication services etc. Almost all \\nservice providers across the world provide the facility of accepting late payments \\nwith late fine or penalty. Even if this service is described as a service of \\ntolerating the act of late payment, it is an ancillary supply naturally bundled and \\nsupplied in conjunction with the principal supply, and therefore should be \\nassessed as the principal supply. Since it is ancillary to and naturally bundled \\nwith the principal supply such as of electricity, water, telecommunication, \\ncooking gas, insurance etc. it should be assessed at the same rate as the principal \\nsupply. However, the same cannot be said of cheque dishonor fine or penalty as \\ndiscussed in the preceding paragraphs. \\n5.9 Fixed Capacity charges for Power \\n10. The price charged for electricity by the power generating companies from \\nthe State Electricity Boards (SEBs)/DISCOMS or by SEBs/DISCOMs from \\nindividual customers has two components, namely, a minimum fixed charge (or \\ncapacity charge) and variable per unit charge. The minimum fixed charges have \\nto be paid by the SEBs/DISCOMS/individual customers irrespective of the \\nquantity of electricity scheduled or purchased by them during a month. They take \\ncare of the fixed cost of generating/supplying electricity. The variable charges are \\ncharged per unit of electricity purchased and increase or decrease every month \\ndepending on the quantity of electricity consumed.',\n",
              " '916 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 46 \\n10.1 The fact that the minimum fixed charges remain the same whether \\nelectricity is consumed or not or it is scheduled/consumed below the contracted \\nor available capacity or a minimum threshold, does not mean that minimum fixed \\ncharge or part of it is a charge for tolerating the act of not scheduling or \\nconsuming the minimum the contracted or available capacity or a minimum \\nthreshold. \\n10.2 Both the components of the price, the minimum fixed charges/capacity \\ncharges and the variable/energy charges are charged for sale of electricity and are \\nthus not taxable as electricity is exempt from GST. Power purchase agreements \\nmay have provisions that the power producer shall not supply electricity to a \\nthird party without approval of buyer. Such agreements which ensure assured \\nsupply of power to State Electricity Boards/DISCOMS are ancillary \\narrangements; the contract is essentially for supply of electricity. \\n5.10 Cancellation charges \\n11. A supply contracted for, such as booking of hotel accommodation, an \\nentertainment event or a journey, may be cancelled by a customer or may not \\nproceed as intended due to his failure to show up for availing the same at the \\ndesignated place and time. The supplier may allow cancelation of supply by the \\ncustomer within a certain specified time period on payment of cancellation fee as \\nper commercial terms of the contract. In case the customer does not show up for \\navailing the service, the supplier may retain or forfeit part of the consideration or \\nsecurity deposit or earnest money paid by the customer for the intended supply. \\n11.1 It is a common business practice for suppliers of services such as hotel \\naccommodation, tour and travel, transportation etc. to provide the facility of \\ncancellation of the intended supplies within a certain time period on payment of \\ncancellation fee. Cancellation fee can be considered as the charges for the costs \\ninvolved in making arrangements for the intended supply and the costs involved \\nin cancellation of the supply, such as in cancellation of reserved tickets by the \\nIndian Railways. \\n11.2 Services such as transportation travel and tour constitute a bundle of \\nservices. The transportation service, for instance, starts with booking of the ticket \\nfor travel and lasts at least till exit of the passenger from the destination terminal. \\nAll services such as making available an online portal or convenient booking \\ncounters with basic facilities at the transportation terminal or in the city, to \\nreserve the seats and issue tickets for reserved seats much in advance of the \\ntravel, giving preferred seats with or without extra cost, lounge and waiting room \\nfacilities at airports, railway stations and bus terminals, provision of basic \\nnecessities such as soap and other toiletries in the wash rooms, clean drinking \\nwater in the waiting area etc. form part and parcel of the transportation service; \\nthey constitute the various elements of passenger transportation service, a \\ncomposite supply. The facilitation service of allowing cancellation against \\npayment of cancellation charges is also a natural part of this bundle. It is \\ninvariably supplied by all suppliers of passenger transportation service as',\n",
              " 'Chap. 46 \\nLiquidated Damages under GST \\n917 \\nnaturally bundled and in conjunction with the principal supply of transportation \\nin the ordinary course of business. \\n11.3 Therefore, facilitation supply of allowing cancellation of an intended \\nsupply against payment of cancellation fee or retention or forfeiture of a part or \\nwhole of the consideration or security deposit in such cases should be assessed as \\nthe principal supply. For example, cancellation charges of railway tickets for a \\nclass would attract GST at the same rate as applicable to the class of travel (i.e., \\n5% GST on first class or air-conditioned coach ticket and nil for other classes \\nsuch as second sleeper class). Same is the case for air travel. \\n11.4 Accordingly, the amount forfeited in the case of non-refundable ticket \\nfor air travel or security deposit or earnest money forfeited in case of the \\ncustomer failing to avail the travel, tour operator or hotel accommodation service \\nor such other intended supplies should be assessed at the same rate as applicable \\nto the service contract, say air transport or tour operator service, or other such \\nservices.  \\n11.5 However, as discussed above, forfeiture of earnest money by a seller in \\ncase of breach of ‘an agreement to sell’ an immovable property by the buyer or \\nsuch forfeiture by Government or local authority in the event of a successful \\nbidder failing to act after winning the bid for allotment of natural resources, is a \\nmere flow of money, as the buyer or the successful bidder does not get anything \\nin return for such forfeiture of earnest money. Forfeiture of earnest money is \\nstipulated in such cases not as a consideration for tolerating the breach of \\ncontract but as a compensation for the losses suffered and as a penalty for \\ndiscouraging the non-serious buyers or bidders. Such payments being merely \\nflow of money are not a consideration for any supply and are not taxable. \\n12. Field formations are advised that while the taxability in each case shall \\ndepend on facts of that case, the above guidelines may be followed in \\ndetermining whether tax on an activity or transaction needs to be paid treating the \\nsame as service by way of agreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act or to \\ntolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act. \\nVide Circular No. 178/10/2022-GST, dated 03.08.2022 \\n6.

As per Section 8 of the IGST Act, supply of goods or services to or \\nby SEZ developer or unit would not be considered as intra-State supply. Hence \\nthe provisions of Section 7 and Section 8 of IGST Act, 2017 read with the \\ndefinition of SEZ developer given at Section 2(20) of IGST Act, mandate that all \\nthe supply of goods or services made by or to SEZ Co-developer would be \\nconsidered as inter-State supply and the levy of IGST is attracted at the \\napplicable rate. But the IGST law allows the benefit of zero rating to supplies \\nmade to an SEZ unit. As per Section 16(1) of IGST Act ‘zero rated supply’ \\nmeans any of the following supply of goods or services or both namely (a) export \\nof goods or services or both; or (b) supply of goods or services or both to a SEZ \\ndeveloper or SEZ Unit. Section 2(m)(iii) of SEZ Act, 2005 defines export means \\nsupplying goods, or providing services, from one unit to another unit or \\ndeveloper, in the same or different special economic zone. A combined reading \\nof Section 16(1) of IGST Act and Section 2(m)(iii) of SEZ Act indicate that \\nsupply of services made by the applicant to other units or developers of SEZ \\nwould be zero rated supply. Rendering of services from SEZ to DTA does not \\nqualify as zero rated supply in terms of Section 16 of IGST Act, 2017. Therefore, \\nSEZ Unit/developer making inter-State supply to DTA would be liable to pay \\nIGST under IGST Act. Therefore, supply of services by the SEZ unit or \\nDeveloper from SEZ to DTA would be covered under the normal course of \\nsupply.

Statutory provisions of supply to SEZ  \\nThe supplies to an SEZ Unit/to a developer of an SEZ are governed under \\nIGST Act, 2017 in the GST regime. Any supply of goods or services or both to \\nan SEZ Unit/Developer of an SEZ by a registered person is treated as an export. \\nSupplies from DTA to a SEZ Unit/Developer of SEZ qualify for Zero Rated in \\nterms of section 16 of the IGST Act, 2017. According to this provision zero-rated \\nsupply means goods or services or both supplying to a SEZ Unit/developer of \\nSEZ as no levy of tax on these supplies. \\n2. Important definitions  \\n“SEZ” means Special Economic Zone deemed to be a territory outside the \\ncustoms territory of India for the purpose of undertaking the authorised \\noperations in terms of Section 53(1) of the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005. \\n“Export goods” means any goods which are to be taken out of India to a \\nplace outside India in terms of Section 2(19) of the Customs Act, 1962 and \\nSection 2(5) of the IGST Act, 2017 defines “export of goods” with its \\ngrammatical variations and cognate expressions, means taking goods out of India \\nto a place outside India; \\nSection 2(6) of the IGST Act, 2017 defines “Export of Services “means the \\nsupply of any services when,— \\n \\n(i) the supplier of service is located in India;',\n",

Accordingly, while no tax would be payable on such supplies, \\nthe exporter will be eligible to claim the corresponding input tax credits. It is \\nrelevant to note that the input tax credits would be available to an exporter even \\nif supplies were exempt supplies as long as the eligibility of the input taxes as \\ninput tax credits is established. \\nThe exporter may utilize such credits for discharge of other output taxes or \\nalternatively, the exporter may claim a refund of such taxes. \\n3. Refund on zero-rated supplies \\nA registered person making zero rated supply shall be eligible to claim \\nrefund under either of the following options, namely:–– \\n \\n(a) he may supply goods or services or both under bond or Letter of \\nUndertaking, without payment of integrated tax and claim refund of \\nunutilized input tax credit; or  \\n \\n(b) he may supply goods or services or both, on payment of integrated tax \\nand claim refund of such tax paid on goods or services or both supplied, \\nin accordance with the provisions of Section 54 of the Central Goods and \\nServices Tax Act or the rules made thereunder”. \\nTherefore, a registered person has to choose one of the above cited two \\noptions as per the convenience.

It would not include other bodies which are merely described as \\na ‘local body’ by virtue of a local law of State or Central Government. For \\nexample, State Governments have setup local development authorities to \\nundertaken developmental works like infrastructure, housing, etc. The \\nGovernments setup these authorities under the Town and planning Act. Examples \\nof such development authorities are Delhi Development Authority, Ahmedabad \\nDevelopment \\nAuthority, \\nBangalore \\nDevelopment \\nAuthority, \\nChennai \\nMetropolitan Development Authority, Bihar Industrial Area Development \\nAuthority, etc. Such developmental authorities formed under the Town and \\nPlanning Act, are not qualified as local authorities for the purposes of the CGST \\nActs.  \\n3.

Such a \\nstatutory body, corporation or an authority as a juridical entity is separate from \\nthe State and cannot be regarded as the Central or a State Government and also \\ndoes not fall in the definition of ‘local authority’. Thus, regulatory bodies and \\nother autonomous entities would not be regarded as the Government or local \\nauthorities for the purposes of the GST Acts. \\n4. Corporations and Autonomous Bodies are not Government \\nVarious corporations formed under the Central Acts or State Acts or various \\ngovernment companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956/2013 or \\nautonomous institutions set up by special Acts are not covered under the \\ndefinition of ‘Government’. The corporations formed under the Central or a State \\nAct or various companies registered under the Companies Act, 1956/2013 or \\nautonomous institutions set up by the State Acts will not be covered under the \\ndefinition of ‘Government’.

Introduction \\nGST Compensation Cess is the additional levy on notified goods in \\nadditional to applicable GST on these goods. \\nGoods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 was enacted to \\nlevy Compensation Cess for providing compensation to the States for the loss of \\nrevenue arising on account of implementation of the goods and services tax with \\neffect from the date from which the provisions of the Central Goods and Services \\nTax Act was brought into force (1-7-2017), for a period of five years or for such \\nperiod as may be prescribed on the recommendations of the GST Council. \\nSection 2(c) of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 defines “Cess \\n“means the goods and services tax compensation cess levied under Section 8 of \\nthe Act. \\nSection 2(d) of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 defines \\n“Compensation” means an amount, in the form goods and services tax \\ncompensation, as determined under Section 7 of the Act. \\n2. Requirement of Compensation Cess in GST \\nDue to implementation of GST in the country, many manufacturing States \\nsuffered a decrease in revenue as GST is a destination and consumption based \\ntax. The manufacturing Sates namely Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu were \\nlikely to lose revenue on account of GST.',\n",
              " 'Chap. 50 \\nGST Compensation Cess \\n949 \\nThe main reason for the loss of revenue was that Central Sales Tax (CST) \\nwas an origin-based tax, which was levied by the Central Government but \\ncollected and appropriated by the State Government. Thereby by the Origin State \\nwas availing benefit of CST even though the goods were not consumed in the \\nsame State. \\nIn the GST provisions the Origin State where the goods will be supplies to \\nanother State will charge IGST but the IGST will accrue to the consuming State. \\nThereby causing loss of revenue to the State from where goods were supplied. \\nThe Government had introduced the additional levy of Compensation cess in \\norder r to compensate the loss to the Origin State. \\n3. Basis of levy of Compensation Cess on goods \\nThe compensation cess on goods imported into India shall be levied and \\ncollected in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Customs Tariff \\nAct, 1975, at the point when duties of customs are levied on the said goods under \\nSection 12 of the Customs Act, 1962, on a value determined under the Customs \\nTariff Act, 1975. \\nCompensation Cess will not be charged on goods exported by an exporter \\nunder bond and the exporter will be eligible for refund of input tax credit of \\nCompensation Cess relating to goods exported. In case goods have been exported \\non the payment of Compensation Cess the exporter will be eligible for refund of \\nCompensation Cess paid on goods exported by him. Compensation cess shall not \\nbe leviable on supplies made by a taxable person who has decided to opt for \\ncomposition levy. \\n4. Value for calculation of Compensation Cess  \\nThe compensation cess is chargeable on notified supply of goods with \\nreference to their transaction value, then for each such supply, the value has to be \\ndetermined under Section 15 of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \\nlike GST charged on these goods. \\n5. Who will collect the Compensation Cess?  \\nA taxable person selling or supplying goods on payment of GST, is required \\nto charge compensation cess on notified goods as per the rates as notified by the \\nGovernment. The supplier has to collect compensation cess and pay to the \\nGovernment against outward supply of notified goods. \\n6. Input Tax Credit \\nThe input tax credit in respect of compensation cess on supply of goods or \\nservices can be utilised only towards payment of the compensation cess on \\nsupply of goods or services. Compensation cess cannot be utlised for payment of \\nGST such as CGST/SGST/UTIGST and IGST. \\n7. Usage of Compensation Cess  \\nAll the proceeds received from the GST compensation cess would be \\ncredited to a non-lapsable fund known as the Goods and Services Tax \\nCompensation Fund. The funds would then be used for compensating tax revenue \\nloss to States on account of GST implementation. If any funds are unutilized, \\nthen at the end of the transition period, it would be shared in half by the Central',\n",
              " '950 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 50 \\nGovernment and all State Governments. State government’s share would be \\ndistributed in the ratio of their total revenues from the State tax or the Union \\nterritory goods and services tax, in the last year of the transition period. \\n8.

Introduction  \\nCo-operative Housing Societies are entities registered under the co-operative \\nlaws of the respective States. According to Section 2(16) of the Maharashtra Co-\\noperative Society Act, 1960, “housing society” means a society, the object of \\nwhich is to provide its members with open plots for housing, dwelling houses or \\nflats; or if open plots, the dwelling houses or flats are already acquired, to \\nprovide its members common amenities and services. \\nTherefore, a residential society is a collective body of persons, who stay in a \\nresidential society. As a collective body, they would be supplying certain \\nservices to its members, be it collecting statutory dues from its members and \\nremitting to statutory authorities, maintenance of the building, security etc. \\nA Society is akin to a club, which is composed of its members. Accordingly, \\nthe service provided by a Housing Society to its members is to be treated as \\nservice provided by one person to another. \\n2. Statutory provisions of Levy of GST  \\nAs per Section 9 of CGST Act, 2017 for levy of GST is on supply of goods \\nand services. As per Section 7 expression “supply” includes— \\n \\n(a) all forms of supply of goods or services or both such as sale, transfer, \\nbarter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be \\nmade for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of \\nbusiness; \\nThe definition of “person” in Section 2(84)(i) of the CGST Act, 2017 \\nspecifically includes a co-operative society registered under any law relating to \\nco-operative societies. Thus a registered co-operative society is a person within \\nthe meaning of the term in the CGST Act. \\nThe activity of the society can be said to be in the course or furtherance of \\nbusiness. The definition of business as per Section 2(17) of the CGST Act, 2017, \\n“business” includes––',\n",
              " 'Chap. 51 \\nGST on Cooperative Housing Societies \\n955 \\n \\n(a)  any trade, commerce, manufacture, profession, vocation, adventure, \\nwager or any other similar activity, whether or not it is for a pecuniary \\nbenefit;  \\n \\n(b)  any activity or transaction in connection with or incidental or ancillary to \\nsub-clause (a); \\n \\n(c)  any activity or transaction in the nature of sub-clause (a), whether or not \\nthere is volume, frequency, continuity or regularity of such transaction; \\n \\n(d)  supply or acquisition of goods including capital goods and services in \\nconnection with commencement or closure of business; \\n \\n(e) provision by a club, association, society, or any such body (for a \\nsubscription or any other consideration) of the facilities or benefits to its \\nmembers; \\n \\n(f)  admission, for a consideration, of persons to any premises; \\n \\n(g) services supplied by a person as the holder of an office which has been \\naccepted by him in the course or furtherance of his trade, profession or \\nvocation; \\n \\n(h) services provided by a race club by way of totalisator or a licence to \\nbook maker in such club; and \\n \\n(i) any activity or transaction undertaken by the Central Government, a \\nState Government or any local authority in which they are engaged as \\npublic authorities. \\nThus, as per Section 2(17)(e) of the CGST Act, 2017 provision by a club, \\nassociation, society, or any such body (for a subscription or any other \\nconsideration) of the facilities or benefits to its members is deemed to be a \\nbusiness. The activities of the housing society would thus attract the levy of GST \\nand the housing society would be required to register and comply with the GST \\nLaw. \\n3. Requirement of registration & taxability \\nAs per the threshold provision of registration, if the turnover of housing \\nsociety is above `20 lakhs, it needs to take registration under GST in terms of \\nSection 22 of the CGST Act, 2017. However, taking registration does not mean \\nthat the housing society has to compulsorily charge GST in the monthly \\nmaintenance bills raised on its members. Notification No. 12/2017-C.T. (Rate), \\ndated 28-6-2017 at Sr. No. 77 as amended by Notification No. 2/2018-C.T., dated \\n25-1-2018 provides for the following exemption to housing societies: \\nService by an unincorporated body or a non-profit entity registered under any \\nlaw for the time being in force, to its own members by way of reimbursement of \\ncharges or share of contribution— \\n \\n(a)  as a trade union;  \\n \\n(b)  for the provision of carrying out any activity which is exempt from the \\nlevy of Goods and service Tax; or',\n",

However, GST \\nwould be applicable if the monthly contribution exceeds `7500/-. \\nIn addition to monthly, certain statutory dues such as property tax, electricity \\ncharges etc. form part of the monthly maintenance bill raised by the society on its \\nmembers. These charges should be excluded while computing the monthly limit \\nof ` 7500/- in terms of clause (c) of Sr. No. 77 of Notification No. 12/2017-C.T. \\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017 as amended by Notification No. 2/2018-C.T., dated 25-\\n1-2018. \\nThus, if monthly bill is more than `7500/- then GST will be applicable on \\namount in excess of `7500/-. \\n4.

MSMEs are \\nclassified in two categories Manufacturing Enterprises and Service Enterprises as \\nper the provision of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development \\n(MSMED) Act, 2006. \\n2. Manufacturing Enterprises \\nThe enterprises engaged in the manufacture or production of goods \\npertaining to any industry specified in the first schedule to the Industries \\nDevelopment and Regulation Act, 1951 or employing plant and machinery in the \\nprocess of value addition to the final product having a distinct name or character \\nor use. The manufacturing Enterprises are defined in terms of investment in Plant \\nand Machinery. As notified vide S.O. 1642(E), dated 29th September, 2006 \\nissued by the Ministry of MSME, Government of India, New Delhi, \\n \\n(a) Micro Enterprise: investment in plant and machinery is less than or equal \\nto `25 lakhs.  \\n \\n(b) Small Enterprise: investment in plant and machinery is more than `25 \\nlakhs but limited to `5 crore.',\n",

Service Enterprises \\nThe enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services are defined in \\nterms of investment in equipment for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. \\n \\n(a) Micro Enterprise: investment in equipment does not exceed `10 lakhs.  \\n \\n(b) Small Enterprise: investment in equipment is more than `10 lakhs but \\nlimited to `2 crore. \\n \\n(c) Medium Enterprise: investment in equipment is between `2 crore to `5 \\ncrore.  \\n4. MSME Re-defined  \\nThe Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise has redefined the \\ndefinition of MSME with effect from 1st July 2020. \\nNew MSME Classification w.e.f July 1, 2020: \\nComposite Criteria of Investment in Plant & Machinery or Equipment and \\nTurnover. \\nClassification \\nMicro \\nSmall \\nMedium \\nManufacturing & \\nServices \\nInvestment does \\nnot exceed `1 \\ncrore and \\nTurnover does not \\nexceed `5 crore \\nInvestment does \\nnot exceed `10 \\ncrore and \\nTurnover does not \\nexceed `50 crore \\nInvestment does \\nnot exceed `50 \\ncrore and \\nTurnover does not \\nexceed `250 crore \\n \\n(i) A composite criterion of investment in plant &Machinery or Equipment \\nand Turnover, as detailed in the matrix above, shall apply for \\nclassification fan enterprise as micro, small or medium. \\n \\n(ii) The criteria is applicable to enterprise for both manufacturing and \\nservices sector. \\n (iii) If an enterprise crosses the ceiling limits specified for its present \\ncategory in either of the two criteria of investment or turnover, it will \\ncease to exist in that category and be placed in the next higher category \\nbut no enterprise shall be placed in the lower category unless it goes \\nbelow the ceiling limits specified for its present category in both the \\ncriteria of investment as well as turnover. \\n (iv) All units with Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN) \\nlisted against the same Permanent Account Number (PAN) shall be  \\ncollectively treated as one enterprise and the turnover and investment \\nfigures for all of such entities shall be seen together and only the \\naggregate values will be considered for deciding the category as micro, \\nsmall or medium enterprise. \\nThe MSME sector contributes significantly to the national economy and is \\nthe largest employment provider besides being a breeding ground for \\nentrepreneurship and skill development. The number of MSMEs is more than 30',\n",

Out of these micro \\nenterprises are around 90%, small enterprises are around 9% while the number of \\nmedium enterprises is less than 1%. In spite of having the potential and inherent \\ncapabilities to grow, MSMEs in India have been facing a number of problems \\nlike sub-optional scale of operational, technological obsolescence, supply chain \\ninefficiencies, increasing domestic and global competition, fund shortages, \\nchange in manufacturing strategies and turbulent and uncertain market scenario. \\nTo survive in such a scenario and compete with large and global enterprises, \\nMSMEs need to be supported and assisted to ensure sustained growth and \\ndevelopment in the existing competitive arena. It is understood that the cost of \\ncompliance in terms of statutory laws is proportionately much higher for MSMEs \\nvis-a-vis the bigger companies. Therefore, some relaxation benefits are necessary \\nin order to help them cope with sudden increase/change in compliance \\nchallenges. \\n5. Benefits to MSMEs under GST  \\nWith the implementation of GST, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises \\nhave been accorded with lot of benefits in terms of compliance reliefs given in \\nthe form of threshold exemptions, Composition levy scheme, quarterly filing of \\nthe GST returns to mention a few. While doing so, it has also been kept in mind \\nthat they do not become uncompetitive even as they are given all the benefits of \\nGST. \\n6. Compliance benefits for MSMEs under GST  \\nAs a trade facilitation measure based on turnover, following Micro, Small \\nand Medium enterprises are not required to obtain GST registration: \\n \\n(i) Persons involved in intra: State taxable supply of goods or services or \\nboth, if his aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed \\nprescribed amount of threshold exemption limit i.e. ``20 lakhs (`10 \\nlakhs in case of the special category states of Nagaland, Manipur, \\nMizoram and Tripura).  \\n \\n(ii) Persons involved in inter: State taxable supply of services only (not \\ngoods), if his aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed \\nprescribed amount of threshold exemption limit i.e. `20 lakhs (`10 lakhs \\nin case of the special category states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram \\nand Tripura). \\nFor inter-state suppliers of goods, registration under GST is a compulsory, \\neven if their aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed the threshold \\nlimit. \\n7. Composition levy scheme  \\nComposition levy scheme in GST is an alternative method of levy of tax \\ndesigned for micro, small and medium taxpayers whose turnover is upto the \\nprescribed limit. It is very simple, hassle free compliance scheme for small \\ntaxpayers. It is a voluntary and optional scheme. A person opting to pay tax \\nunder composition levy scheme can neither take input tax credit nor it can collect \\nany tax from the recipient. The salient features of composition levy scheme are:',\n",

This amount cannot be collected from the customers. \\n (vi) The tax has to be paid on quarterly basis. Such taxpayer does not have to \\nmaintain elaborate accounts and records and instead of two monthly \\nstatements and a return (which a normal taxpayer has to file under GST), \\nhe has to file a simple quarterly return in FORM GSTR-04. \\n (vii) A taxable person opting for the scheme has to issue bill of supply as he is \\nnot eligible to issue taxable invoice under GST. He has to mention the \\nwords “composition taxable person, not eligible to collect tax on \\nsupplies” at the top of every bill of supply issued by him. \\n[As per the recent amendment in the CGST Act vide the CGST (Amendment) \\nAct, 2018 following changes have come in respect of composition scheme, \\nhowever, the notification for date of implementation of the amendment Act is yet \\nto be issued. \\n \\n(i) Government empowered to enhance upper limit for composition scheme \\nto `1.50 crore by notification  \\n \\n(ii) A person who opts to pay tax under composition scheme may supply \\nservices, of value not exceeding ten per cent of turnover in a State or \\nUnion territory in the preceding financial year or five lakh rupees, \\nwhichever is higher.] \\n8.

However, there is no specific format \\nprescribed as such for a tax invoice. \\nIn case of supply of goods, the tax invoice has to be prepared in triplicate \\n(original for buyer, duplicate for transporter and triplicate for supplier); whereas \\nin case of service, the invoice has to be prepared in duplicate (original for buyer \\nand duplicate for supplier). \\n10. Special invoice provisions for MSME Sector  \\nThe HSN code required to be mentioned in tax invoice has been done away \\nfor taxpayers upto annual turnover of upto `1.5 crores. Further, taxpayers having \\nannual turnover between `1.5 Crore to `5 crores may mention first two digits of \\nHSN code in their invoices and taxpayers having annual turnover above `5 crores \\nneed to mention full 4 digit HSN code in their invoices. \\n11. Exemption from compulsory audit by CA for MSME Sector  \\nIn GST regime, every registered person whose turnover during a financial \\nyear exceeds the prescribed limit is required to get his accounts audited by a \\nchartered accountant or a cost accountant. As a trade facilitation measure, \\ngovernment has noticed that registered persons having annual turnover upto `2 \\ncrores are exempted from getting their accounts audited by a chartered \\naccountant or a cost accountant. \\n12. Returns in GST  \\nGST Act has provided the manner and time of furnishing of the details of \\noutward supplies by a registered person, other than certain categories of \\nregistered person and manner and time of communication of these details to the \\ncorresponding recipients. The act also has provided for manner and time period \\nfor rectification of errors or omission and payment of tax and interest, if any. \\n13. Return filing process  \\nAll eligible registered persons need to furnish electronically, in FORM \\nGSTR-1, the details of outward supplies of goods or services or both effected \\nduring a tax period on or before the tenth day of succeeding month. \\nSimilarly, all eligible registered persons are required to furnish electronically, \\nin FORM GSTR-3B, a summary return of liabilities, input tax credit and \\npayment of tax pertaining to the month on or before the twentieth day of  \\n \\nsucceeding month return for the entire quarter.

Special return filing provision for MSME Sector  \\nAs a trade facilitation measure, the government has notified that all the \\neligible registered person having annual turnover upto `1.5 crores may opt for \\nfiling quarterly return, in FORM GSTR-1 (i.e. the details of outward supplies of \\ngoods or services or both effected during a quarter.) \\n15. Proposed system of simplified GST return filing process \\nGST Council has recently approved the new return formats and associated \\nchanges in law. The major changes is the option of filing quarterly return with \\nmonthly payment of tax in a simplified return format by the small tax payers. The \\nsalient features of proposed GST return filing process are given below: \\n1. Monthly Return and due-date: All taxpayers excluding a few exceptions \\nlike small taxpayers, composition dealer, Input Service Distributor (ISD), Non-\\nresident registered person, persons liable to deduct tax at source under Section 51 \\nof CGST Act, 2017, persons liable to collect tax at source under Section 52 of the \\nCGST Act, 2017, shall file one monthly return.

These small taxpayers shall have \\nfacility to file quarterly return with monthly payment of taxes on self-declaration \\nbasis. However, the facility would be optional and small taxpayer can also file \\nmonthly return like a large taxpayer. \\n16. E-Way Bill in GST \\nGST Electronic Way Bill i.e. E-Way Bill (EWB) has been implemented in \\nIndia from 1st April 2018 for inter-state movement of goods and from 16th June \\n2018, all 36 States/Union Territories have made EWB applicable for intra-State \\nmovement of goods. \\nThe salient features of GST E-Way Bill System are: \\n(1) EWB is a document required for movement of goods from one place to \\nanother. The movement may be either (i) from supplier to recipient and vice \\nversa; or (ii) from manufacturer to job worker and vice versa; or (iii) between \\ntwo premises of same businessman; or (iv) for any other purpose.  \\n(2) EWB is to be generated by every registered person causing movement of \\ngoods of consignment value (inclusive of GST) exceeding `50,000/-. For \\nconsignments even below `50,000/-, EWB is mandatory in case of inter-State \\nmovement of (i) goods being sent for job work; and (ii) handicraft goods. \\n(3) There can be four situations for movement of goods: \\n \\n(i) Registered supplier to registered recipient: EWB may be generated by \\neither of them depending on terms of delivery i.e. the person causing \\nmovement of goods is responsible for EWB generation.',\n",
              " '974 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 54 \\n \\n(ii) Registered supplier to unregistered recipient: EWB to be generated \\nmandatorily by registered supplier. \\n (iii) Unregistered supplier to registered recipient: In such supplies, the \\nmovement of goods is deemed to have been caused by registered \\nrecipient and he is required to generate EWB. \\n (iv) Unregistered supplier to unregistered recipient: In such transactions, \\nthough EWB Is not mandatory, it can be generated by either of them on \\nvoluntary basis. \\n(4) Normally EWB is not required for exempted goods. In addition, there are \\nfew items for which EWB is not required as detailed in Annexure to Rule \\n138(14) of the CGST Rules.  \\n(5) No distance exemption clause in EWB provisions. Any direct movement \\nof goods between supplier and recipient warrants EWB, irrespective of distance. \\nHowever, for Intra-Sate movement of goods from supplier’s premises to \\ntransporter and from transporter’s premises to recipient, part B is not mandatory, \\nif the said distance is below 50 km. \\n(6) Validity period: For non over dimensional cargo (ODC) cargo, the \\nvalidity is one day for every 100 km. or part thereof. However, in case of ODC \\ncargo, one day is given for every 20 km. or part thereof. Validity starts from the \\ntime of part B updation (i.e. vehicle number entry) and first day lasts till 12 \\nmidnight of next day. \\n(7) No changes can be done in part A (i.e. consignment details) of EWB \\nonce generated. However, part B (i.e. vehicle details) can be updated any number \\nof times within validity period. However, in case of wrong details fed, EWB can \\nbe cancelled by generator within 24 hours provided it has not be verified in \\ntransit. \\n(8) EWB can be cancelled by generator within 24 hours; whereas it can be \\nrejected by recipient within 72 hours or the time of delivery of the goods, \\nwhichever is earlier. If recipient does not reject EWB within 72 hours, it would \\nbe treated as deemed accepted by him. \\n(9) EWB can be generated online on https://www. ewaybillgst.gov.in. In \\naddition to web, EWB can be generated by SMS, Android App, APIs, bulk \\nutility, etc. \\n17. Measures taken for the MSME sector under GST  \\nVarious decisions have been taken by the GST Council in its various \\nmeetings for the benefit of the MSME sector. The details of such major decisions \\nare as below: \\n \\n(i) Goods predominantly manufactured and/or used in the unorganized \\nMSME sector have been kept at lower rates or are exempted. For \\ninstance, electrical switches and wires, pipeline, plastic products, etc. are \\nlargely produced by MSMEs and they earlier did not pay Central Excise \\nduty and therefore tax rate on these have been brought down from 28% \\nto 18%. Similarly, rates of GST on jute and coir like hand bags, ropes \\netc., which are mainly made in the cottage sector, have been reduced',\n",

MSME — FAQ’s \\nQuestion 1: What is GST?  \\nAnswer: GST stands for Goods and Services Tax, which is levied on supply \\nof goods or services. “Supply” is a legal term which has very broad sweep and \\nvarious types of economic activities are covered by it. For example, sale of goods \\nis a type of supply. \\nQuestion 2: On what supply is GST levied? \\nAnswer: GST is levied on all types of supplies which are - (i) made for a \\nconsideration and (ii) are in the course or furtherance of business. There are some \\nexceptions when these conditions are not met, yet supply is considered to have \\nbeen made, for example, inter-state stock transfer of goods even without',\n",
              " 'Chap. 54 \\nGST - MSME \\n981 \\nconsideration or importation of services even if not in the furtherance of \\nbusiness. \\nQuestion 3: Will GST be levied on all goods or services or both? \\nAnswer: No, GST will not be levied on  alcohol for human consumption. \\nGST on Crude, Motor Spirit (Petrol), High Speed Diesel, Aviation Turbine Fuel \\nand Natural Gas will be levied with effect from a date to be decided by the GST \\nCouncil. Electricity and sale of land and building are exempted from levy of \\nGST. Securities are neither goods nor services for the purposes of the Act and \\ntherefore supply of securities is not taxable. \\nQuestion 4: How many types of GST will be levied on different kinds of supply \\nof goods or services? \\nAnswer: GST is a dual levy to be  simultaneously levied by both Centre \\nand State. On every supply within a State (intra-State supply), GST levied will \\nhave two components - Central Tax and State Tax popularly called CGST and \\nSGST/UTGST. On every supply across States (inter-State), Integrated Tax \\npopularly called IGST will be levied. The rate of CGST and SGST/UTGST \\nwould be equal. IGST would be levied at a rate equal to the sum of CGST and \\nSGST/UTGST. \\nQuestion 5: Whether a registered person will have to approach two authorities \\n- Centre as well as State for various permissions, audit etc. under the Act? \\nAnswer: No, a registered person will have to approach only one tax authority \\nfor all practical purposes. Each registered-person would have one tax \\nadministration office, either of the Centre or of the State. Legal provisions (called \\ncross-empowerment) have been made to ensure that one officer can discharge all \\nfunctions under CCST, SGST and ICST Act. The registered person would be \\ninformed of the tax administration concerned with him. A common registration is \\ngranted for the purposes of CGST, SGST/UTGST and IGST. \\nQuestion 6: What is destination based consumption tax? \\nAnswer: When a supply originates in one State and is consumed in another \\nState, tax can accrue to either of the two States. In a destination based \\nconsumption tax, taxes accrue to the State where the supply is consumed. In \\norigin based tax, the tax accrues to the State where the supply originates. GST is \\nbasically a destination based consumption tax. For example, if a car is \\nmanufactured in Chennai but is purchased eventually by a consumer in Mumbai, \\nSGST (or the State component in IGST) would accrue to Maharashtra and not to \\nTamil Nadu. \\nQuestion 7: Who will pay GST? \\nAnswer: GST is generally paid by the supplier, i.e. the one who makes the \\nsupply after collecting it from the recipient. The supplier collects GST from the \\nrecipient of the supply as part of the consideration. However, in a few \\nexceptional cases, the recipient, would be liable to pay GST to the Government \\non reverse charge basis.',\n",
              " '982 \\nGST Smart Guide \\nChap. 54 \\nQuestion 8: What is Input Tax Credit? \\nAnswer: A person doing business will be purchasing goods/availing services \\nfor making further supplies in the course or furtherance of business. When such \\npurchases are made by him, tax would have been charged by his supplier and \\ncollected from him. Since tax is collected from him, he can avail credit of the tax \\npaid by him to his supplier (that is to say, he can use this amount for making \\npayment of tax due from him on further supply made by him). This is known as \\ninput tax credit for the recipient. \\nQuestion 9: Is GST going to increase compliance burden on the trade? \\nAnswer: No. On the contrary GST will result in streamlining of processes \\nand reduction of compliance burden. GST is a simple tax which uniformly \\napplies across the country. GST has been designed to have minimal human \\ninterface and would be implemented through strong IT platform run by GSTN. \\nAlso, in the earlier regime there were multiple compliances required for taxes \\nsuch as Central Excise, Service tax, VAT etc. with Centre and State. GST makes \\nit single and uniform compliance for indirect taxes across the country. Under \\nGST, there is just one interface with no face-to-face meeting between taxpayers \\nand tax authorities and practically every activity will be done online. \\nQuestion 10: What is the threshold for registration in GST? \\nAnswer: A person having business which has aggregate turnover of more \\nthan `20 lakhs calculated for a given PAN across the country would need to \\nregister under GST. There are some exceptions to this rule as mentioned in \\nsection 24 of the GST Act. Aggregate turnover is defined in section 2(6) of the \\nsaid Act. \\nFor example, assume that a taxable person’s business is in many States on \\nsame PAN. All supplies are below `10 lakhs but collectively they are above `20 \\nlakhs. He would be required to register under GST. \\nQuestion 11: Is an agriculturist liable to registration? \\nAnswer: No. An agriculturist, to the extent of supply of produce out of \\ncultivation of land is not liable to registration. \\nQuestion 12: What is the most important precaution to be taken to avail the \\nfacility of threshold exemption? \\nAnswer: An MSME availing threshold exemption should not make any \\ninter-State supply of goods whatsoever, though the MSME may receive supply \\nfrom other States. They may, however, make inter-State supply of services. \\nQuestion 13: I am engaged exclusively in the business of supplying goods or \\nservices which are exempt from GST. Am I liable for registration? \\nAnswer: No.  \\nQuestion 14: How do I make supply, if I have not applied for registration? \\nAnswer: You should apply for registration at the earliest on the GST \\ncommon portal and obtain application reference number (ARN). You need not \\ndisrupt your business and may continue to make supplies on invoices without \\nGSTIN. The application for registration must be made within 30 days of the',\n",

After registration, you can issue revised invoices as permitted under \\nsection 31(3)(a) of the GST Act. These supplies should be shown in the return \\nand taxes paid on them. \\nQuestion 15: How can an application for fresh registration be made under \\nGST? Within what time will registration be granted? \\nAnswer: Application for fresh registration is to be made electronically on  \\nthe GST common portal (www.gst.gov.in) in FORM GST REG-01. If the details \\nand documents are in order, registration will be granted within 3 working days, \\nexcept in cases where an objection has been raised within this period in which \\ncase registration will be granted within a maximum period of 17 days. \\nQuestion 16: I was registered under VAT but not under Central Excise. Do I \\nneed to apply for new registration? \\nAnswer: No Existing registrants of VAT having valid PAN have been issued \\nProvisional ID and password. If you have not received provisional ID, please \\ncontact your tax administration to obtain the same. This Provisional Identity \\nNumber (PID) would eventually be your GSTIN, when the migration process is \\ncompleted. \\nQuestion 17: If I have obtained provisional GSTIN (PID), can I use the same \\non the invoice to make supply without waiting for final GSTIN? \\nAnswer: Provisional GSTIN (PID) would eventually be your final GSTIN. \\nThe number would remain the same. Yes, you can use this PID on invoice for \\nmaking supply without waiting for final GSTIN. \\nQuestion 18: I am a SME selling printed books after printing and have a \\nturnover of twenty-five lakhs rupees per annum. I print only Children’s \\npicture, drawing or colouring books which are exempt from GST. Do I need to \\nregister? \\nAnswer: No. A person dealing with only exempted supplies is not liable to \\nregistration irrespective of his turnover. Section 23(i)(a) of the GST Act refers. \\nQuestion 19: If I register voluntarily though my turnover is less than `20 \\nlakhs, am I required to pay tax on supplies made post registration? \\nAnswer: Yes. If you obtain voluntary registration despite the turnover being \\nbelow `20 lakhs, you would be treated as a normal taxable person and would \\nneed to pay tax on supplies even if they are below the threshold for registration. \\nYou will also be entitled to take Input tax credit. \\nQuestion 20: How will taxpayer get the certificate of registration? \\nAnswer: The taxpayer can himself download the certificate of registration \\nonline from the GST common portal (www.gst.gov.in). \\nQuestion 21: Can registration particulars once furnished be amended? \\nAnswer: Yes, request for amendment has to be made online. All \\namendments in registration particulars, except some core fields, can be amended \\nin the system without the intervention of any official by merely filing the details \\nof the amendment. Also for amendments of core fields, approval may be needed.',\n",
